{"url": "https://movie-locations.com/movies/0/../0/500-Days-Of-Summer.php", "title": "(500) Days of Summer | 2009", "text_content": "Marc Webb’s endearingly quirky non-romance is filmed largely around the untouristy downtown district ofLos Angeles– not the familiar screenLAof Hollywood bungalows or South Central 'hoods. Yet ironically, this unfamiliar look at the city uses some very familiar locations. It’s rather like watching a slew of dependable character actors suddenly elevated to starring roles.\nFor instance, the stretch ofMain Streetbetween Fourth and Fifth Streets is a frequent backdrop to action sequences – though it’s often passed off as ‘New York’.\nIt’s here you can find the apartment of sadly lovestruck Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), in theCanadian Building, 432 South Main Streetat Winston Street. You might recognise the block as the site of ‘Joppy’s bar’, where Easy Rawlins (Denzel Washington) hangsout inCarl Franklin’s excellent 1995neo noirDevil In A Blue Dress.\nRight acrossMain Street, the store where Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) reveals her fondness forRingo Starr, and the couple rentsSweet and Showerfrom the ‘adult section’, is theFarmers and Merchants Bank Building, Main and Fourth Streets.\nOn the opposite corner, the lobby of theBarclay Hotel,103 West Fourth Street, was transformed into the coffee bar in which Tom and his mates hang out. You’ve probably seen theBarclaydozens of times without noticing – remember the ‘New York’ meteor shower at the beginning ofArmageddon? the monster stomping past it inGodzilla? Or the ‘Manhattan’ cafe whereJack NicholsonannoysHelen HuntinAs Good As It Gets?\nJust to confuse things, Summer's apartment is also a Barclay, although inKoreatown, midtownLos Angeles. It’s theBarclay, 706 South Normandieat West 7th Street, just south of Wilshire Boulevard.\nAlongsideMain StreetrunsSpring Street. The ‘New Hampshire Greeting Card Company’, where Tom writes profound verses for a living, is theFenton Building, 833 South Spring Street, between Eighth and Ninth Streets – which, in the interests of economy was also used for the interior of Tom’s apartment.  In the Thirties, the building housed a ‘taxi dance’ hall (“Ten cents a dance”) called the Roseland Roof.\nThe karaoke bar in which Summer singsSugartownis theRedwood Bar & Grill,316 West Second Street, west of South Broadway, downtown. Once a watering hole for local journalists – as well asJohn F. Kennedyand a youngRichard Nixon, the venue has recently expanded into a proper restaurant. TheRedwoodserves as a ‘Milwaukee’ bar inPaul Feig’sBridesmaids.\nThe day after Tom and Summer spend the night together sees Tom leading a rapturous dance routine inLA’s spanking newCivic Center Mall,running betweenHill StreetandGrand Street, linking Bunker Hill to the Civic Center.   Bursting into life is theArthur J. Will Memorial Fountain.\nIn downtownLos Angeles, Tom wisely advises Summer to “look up”.  Above the bustle of markets and discount stores, the historic heart of the old city stands some glorious, if often decayed, architecture from its heyday in the Twenties.\nAmong his favourite buildings, Tom points out the 1925Fine Arts Building, 811 West Seventh Streetat Wilshire Boulevard.  Remember this place as the ‘Swiss Embassy’ in the 1997 fantasySpawn, withMichael Jai WhiteandJohn Leguizamo? No? Well it was. Trust me.\nAlso the green and gold Moderne tower of theEastern Columbia Building, 849 South Broadway(on top of which the creature appeared inPredator 2, as later did Starscream inMichael Bay’sTransformers).\nTom’s favourite spot, with the bench, wasAngel’s Knoll, a small green space overlooking downtownLAand the oldAngels Flight Railway. The film’s bench was even graced with a plaque commemorating the park’s place in cinema history. But no more. As of July 2013, the park has been fenced off, apparently pending redevelopment.\nIn the film the park is inexplicably referred to as Angelus Plaza – which is actually a nearby location seen inSteven Spielberg’sMinority Report.\nThe bar in which Tom springs to Summer’s defence and gets a smack in the face for his troubles,  is theBroadway Bar,830 South Broadwaybetween West Eighth and West Ninth Streets – alongside the famousOrpheum Theatre(itself a screen regular). A single punch, though, seems to be getting off lightly, compared with the squabble that theTransformersget into immediately outside theBroadway Bar.\nTom appears to travel by train up the coast to attend Millie’s wedding.  In fact, the nuptials are celebrated at thePoint Fermin Lighthouse,807 West Paseo Del Marin,San Pedro, south of the city.  Built in 1874, the Victorian-style Lighthouse was the first navigational light into San Pedro Bay and its light beamed until the blackout ordered after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. The lantern was removed during WWII, but in recent years, the lighthouse has been restored, and on November 1, 2003, was opened to the public.\nTom and Summer  watchVagiant(\"Half vampire! Half giant!\") at theMillion Dollar Theater, 307 South Broadway.\nDirectly opposite the theater stands the wonderfulBradbury Building, 304 South Broadway. This is the office at which Tom attends the job interview at the end of the film. Its elegant interior is famous fromBlade Runner, among many other films.\n", "locations": [{"name": "Main Street", "address": "Main Street", "latitude": 43.6890408, "longitude": -79.3016211, "descriptions": ["For instance, the stretch ofMain Streetbetween Fourth and Fifth Streets is a frequent backdrop to action sequences – though it’s often passed off as ‘New York’.", "Right acrossMain Street, the store where Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) reveals her fondness forRingo Starr, and the couple rentsSweet and Showerfrom the ‘adult section’, is theFarmers and Merchants Bank Building, Main and Fourth Streets.", "AlongsideMain StreetrunsSpring Street.

Yes, it’sShakespeare’sThe Taming Of The Shrewgiven a smart teen makeover. Which is why the school is called ‘Padua High’.\nActually, the setting is the Pacific Northwest ofWashington Stateand the striking building, on a bluff overlookingCommencement Bay, isStadium High School, 111 North E Street, just north of downtownTacoma.Built as a luxury hotel at the turn of the century, it’s named for the school’s huge athletic stadium, constructed in a ravine known as Old Woman’s Gulch, after the widows of local fishermen who once squatted in little shacks here.The home of Kat and Bianca – the Stratford family – is2715 North Junett Street, at North 28th Street, to the northwest ofStadium High.In downtownTacomaitself, the music store, where Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) approaches Kat – and outside which she reverses into Joey’s car – is1117 Broadway. It’s no longer a music store.One of the film’s more unusual locations is the concrete giant emerging from the ground to grab a VW Beetle, alongside which Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) pumps Bianca for information about Kat. This is theFremont Troll, 3405 Troll Avenue North, which you’ll find beneath theAurora Bridgeat North 35th Street, about 25 miles to the north inSeattle. A bit of a journey but, visually, worth the trip.      \n      It was built in 1990 as part of an imaginative plan to clean up what had become a grubby area.While we’re inSeattle, the biker bar where Cameron and Michael (David Krumholtz) find Patrick to tell him about Kat’s idiosyncrasies is, like it says, the Buckaroo Tavern,4201 Fremont AvenueNorth at North 42nd Street. Sadly, since filming it’s  closed.You can still enjoy the outdoors atGasworks Park,2101 North Northlake Way, which is where Patrick and Kat go paintballing.      \n      This 20-acre point on Lake Union was the site of a plant manufacturing gas from coal, rendered obsolete by the Import of natural gas in the 1950s. The city acquired the site which, in 1975, was opened as a public park, retaining several of the original buildings. The boiler house has been converted to a picnic shelter, while the former exhauster-compressor is now a children's play barn.You don’t have to be an avid student ofShakespeareto predict that \n      Kat is going to soften up in the face of Patrick’s relentless quirkiness. And as a high school movie, things will climax at the prom.‘Padua Prom’ is a mix of two different locations. The lavish chandeliered lobby and stairways are theParamount Theatre,911 Pine Streetat Ninth Avenue, in downtownSeattle.The prom itself is held a few blocks east, in theCentury Ballroom,915 East Pine Street.\nBuilt as a luxury hotel at the turn of the century, it’s named for the school’s huge athletic stadium, constructed in a ravine known as Old Woman’s Gulch, after the widows of local fishermen who once squatted in little shacks here.The home of Kat and Bianca – the Stratford family – is2715 North Junett Street, at North 28th Street, to the northwest ofStadium High.In downtownTacomaitself, the music store, where Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) approaches Kat – and outside which she reverses into Joey’s car – is1117 Broadway.

Even the opening scenes, set in ‘Saratoga, New York’ and ‘Washington DC’ are filmed in the South.\nThe street in ‘Saratoga’ of the 1840s, where Northup (Ejiofor) and his family go shopping, isIberville StreetinNew Orleans’French Quarter.\nThe ‘Gadsby Hotel’, supposedly in ‘Washington DC’, to which Northup  is taken by the two deceptively friendly Brown and Hamilton, is the famedColumns Hotel,3811 St Charles Avenue, inNew Orleans’Garden District.

About 40 miles west of New Orleans, the 1858 house, surrounded by oak and magnolia trees dripping with the inevitable Spanish moss,  is a private home, not open to visitors.\nAfter falling foul of spiteful foreman Tibeats (Paul Dano), Northup is passed on to the sadistic and drunken Epps (Michael Fassbender). The Epps cotton plantation isFelicity Plantation, now part of theSt. Joseph Plantation,3535 Highway 18, inVacherie, on the Mississippi about 20 miles north of Schriever.  It’s actually another sugar cane business and, although still family-owned, you can tour the ancestral home, grounds and dependencies, including original slave cabins (though unfortunately not theFelicity Plantationitself at this time). As most tours are guided by family members, there should be plenty of history.\nSt. Josephwas previously the main location forIain Softley’s 2005The Skeleton Key, withKate HudsonandPeter Sarsgaard.\nEpps' ‘gin house’, where the cotton bales are counted, was recreated in theMule ShedatDestrehan Plantation,13034 River Road,Destrehan, much closer to New Orleans.

Neither set the box office alight, butRidley Scott's lavish version way outperformedJohn Glen's disastrousChristopher Columbus: The Discovery, despite the presence ofMarlon Brando.\nThis production uses several of the genuine historical locations inSpain, including the cities ofCaceres;Trujillo;Seville; andSalamanca.\nInSalamanca, scenes were filmed in theOld Cathedral(the city has twin cathedrals fused together as part of the same complex in the centre of town); in theConvento of San Esteban, a Dominican monastery built at the end of the 16th century, and also on thePlaza Mayor.\nIn Seville, filming took place in theReal Alcázar of Sevilla, the royal palace, and in theCasa de Pilatos,Plaza de Pilatos, according to legend a copy of the 'Jerusalem house of Pontius Pilate.

There's a lot to cover, so don't forget the continuation onPage 2.\nDirector and co-writerSam Mendesturns a simple story from the trenches of World War I into an intensely visceral experience by playing out the narrative without any traditional cuts, in what seems like real time.\nTo get an idea of the phenomenal technical achievement, and the contribution of Oscar-winning cinematographerRoger Deakins, listen to the commentaries on the DVD – but see the film on a full-size movie screen first.\nMendesandDeakinskeep the camera shifting imperceptibly between locations and studio sets – all the while ensuring lighting and weather conditions remain consistent throughout.\n1917was made entirely in theUK, withSalisbury PlaininWiltshire, southernEngland, standing in for the flat, open landscape of ‘Northern France’.\nSalisbury Plain, covering 300 square miles of chalk grassland north of the city ofSalisbury, is probably best known as the home of Stonehenge, the ring of prehistoric stones which have stood here for between four and five thousand years.\nMuch of the rest of thePlainis used for army training. Firing ranges and tank manouevres mean that access to some areas is restricted but the sheer extent of unbroken plain meant that the camera could be moved 360° without the constant need to remove buildings or other modern features digitally.\nSix separate spots on thePlainwere used and over a mile of trenches dug, though only after consultation to avoid disturbing the unique ecology or archaeology of the area. It's a tribute to the skills of the greenspeople on the production that, from the areas I saw, absolutely no sign of disturbance remains.\nSimpler interior sets were built inside two large local barns, a standard practice to ensure filming can continue even when weather conditions are not ideal. In this case, though, instead of waiting for the sun, the sets were used when the sun was too bright for the film’s overcast tone.\nThe chaotic and somewhat ramshackle British trenches were dug near to the villageWest Chisenbury, on the A345 north ofAmesbury, and nearErlestoke, a village on theB3098, about 12 miles west.\nIt’s beneath trees onPear Tree Hill, south ofErlestoke, where Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), are woken up at the opening of the film.\nFrom here, they walk down into the trench where they're charged by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) with getting an urgent message to the Devonshire Regiment, to call off a scheduled attack that might cost the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's own brother.\nAs the two enter Erinmore’s bunker, there’s one of the film’s hidden transitions to a surprisingly complex set, built with moving walls to allow fluid camera movement, which was constructed, like most of the main sets, atShepperton StudiosinSurrey.\nThe mission involves not only negotiating a way across No Man’s Land, the hellish wasteland between the frontline trenches, but crossing ground only recently vacated, according to intelligence, by German troops to reach the village of ‘Ecoust’.\nBlake and Schofield go over the top from the frontline trench into the grim desolation of No Man’s Land, dotted with bomb craters, the fly-riddled bodies of dead horses and criss-crossed by barbed-wire, which was created on the site of the oldBovingdon Airfieldsouthwest ofHemel HempsteadinHertfordshire.\nConvenient for the film studios, the site has hosted outdoor sets forWorld War Z, the 'Live Aid' concert inBohemian Rhapsody, the explosions and epic stunts on ‘Scarif’ inRogue One: A Star Wars Story, andBovingdonalso provided that incredibly long runway forFast and Furious 6.\nIn earlier days, the airfield itself was seen in a clutch of classic World War II films, includingThe War Lover,633 Squadron,Battle Of BritainandMosquito Squadron.\nBlake and Schofield are mightily relieved to discover that the Germans really have retreated from their trenches, which they discover are far more sophisticated than the British dugouts.\nThe deserted tunnels explored by the pair were filmed inside those local barns, but the underground bunker where a potentially lethal booby trap is triggered by a hungry rat, was built atShepperton.\nChoking on dust, Blake and Schofield emerge from darkness into a bleached-out compound littered with piles of shells and abandoned artillery.\nThis was a disused quarry inOxfordshire. It’sAmbrose Quarry, onOld London Roadsoutheast of the village ofEwelme, itself about 10 miles southeast of Oxford. Overrun by vegetation, it had to be stripped to the bare rock and earth to become the abandoned German base.▶\nPage 1   |Page 2\n", "locations": [{"name": "1917", "address": "1917, Partido de Punta Indio, Buenos Aires, Argentina", "latitude": -35.3217241, "longitude": -57.2774238, "descriptions": ["1917was made entirely in theUK, withSalisbury PlaininWiltshire, southernEngland, standing in for the flat, open landscape of ‘Northern France’, but with other locations found inOxfordshire,Hertfordshire,County Durhamand evenScotland, seamlessly blended in what appears to be a single take.

He’s staying in a houseboat behind the garage owned by ex-streetracer Tej (Ludacris), which stood at1200 North Ocean DriveinHollywood Beach, about 20 miles to the north ofDowntown Miami. It's since been demolished and the site redeveloped as a parking lot.\nWhen Tej needs a fourth driver for that inevitable race, this time around the streets of Downtown Miami, he calls out O'Conner, whose journey south makes more sense photogenically than it does geographically. One minute he’s crossing theRickenbacker CausewayfromVirginia Key(perhaps he popped into Miami Seaquarium on the way?) to Downtown Miami, and the next he’s beneath the concrete supports of thePort Of Miami Bridge, onDodge Island, still doggedly heading towards Downtown Miami.\nThe starting point for the race isNE 14th Streetat North Miami Avenue, just north ofDowntown, in front of theFirehouse MRKTrestaurant housed in theOld Fire Station No.2at1401 North Miami Avenue, although the ‘Road closed’ sign is thoughtfully being put in place about a mile south, in front of theOlympia Theater,174 East Flagler Streetat 2nd Avenue.\nThe race itself uses a jumble of streets aroundDowntown Miami, most of the time seeming to head south, with a glimpse of the cylindricalAmerican Airlines Arena, home of the NBA's Miami Heat, which stands onBiscayne Boulevardat 8th Street.\nThe drawbridge which is unexpectedly raised to inject a bit of excitement is theSouth Miami Avenue Bridge, whereSouth Miami Avenuecrosses theMiami Riverbetween 3rd and 6th Streets, about a mile south of the AA Arena, though the film digitally transports it to within easy viewing distance of the crowd at the start/finish line.\nO’Conner naturally makes the leap with panache, zooming over leader Slap Jack, who crashes out ignominiously.\nThe cops however are on hand and, despite a valiant escape attempt, O’Conner’s car is ‘tasered’ to a stop, alongside the fishy murals of what was then Capt. Harry’s Fishing Supply Warehouse, onNE 1st Avenue at NE 11th Street. The premises now houses theDowntown Art Housestudio space.\nIf you’re wondering why the cops don’t use this brilliant gizmo more often to end chases – well, that’s because it hasn’t actually been invented yet.\nO’Conner finds himself coerced by US Customs agents Bilkins (Thom Barry) and Markham (James Remar) into working undercover alongside agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) – who may or may not have gone rogue – to provide evidence to bring down drug money smuggler Carter Verone (Cole Hauser).\nO’Conner agrees on condition that he can bring in his own partner from wayback, Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), who’s having his own problems inCalifornia, where he’s racing speedway. There’s a Barstow, of course, in the Mojave Desert, but it doesn’t have a speedway – that’s no more than CG invention\nVerone’s suitably OTT estate to which a clutch of drivers is invited to ‘audition’ for a job alongside the top man is100 SE 32nd Roadat Brickell Avenue inCoconut Grove. The 14-acre estate, built in 1971 overlooking Biscayne Bay, once belonged toSylvester Stalloneand stands alongside the famous Villa Vizcaya, which you might remember fromAce Ventura, Pet Detective. In fact, the two mansions were once part of the same estate.\nThe assignment is to retrieve a package from the glove compartment of Verone’s impounded red Ferrari.\nCompetitors head out to the Everglades on the wonderfully namedAlligator Alley, the east-west Everglades Parkway section ofI-75between 27 and 869. The colourful nickname was originally bestowed by the American Automobile Association who, during construction in the 60s, felt the road would be useless, no more than an \"alley for alligators\". By the time the road opened, the nameAlligator Alleyhad been officially adopted.\nThe oldest sight-gag in the book sees the roaring motors skimming by the dozily unaware guy in the middle of the road, onNW 2nd Avenueat the junction of NW 67th Street,  in theLittle Haitidistrict north of Miami.\nNaturally, O’Conner and Pearce are first to Verone’s car at the impound/boat yard, which is at theRickenbacker Marina,3301 Rickenbacker CausewayonVirginia Key.\nThe ‘East Coast Fisheries’ safe house, in which the pair meet up with their FBI controllers, is40 SW North River Drive, on the Miami River just west of Downtown. Surprisingly, the cover is not an invention of the production’s design team. It was one of the  landmark left over from the commercial fishing industry which once flourished along the Miami River. Sadly, since filming it too has gone.\nO’Conner and Pearce are invited to meet Verone at a nightclub, where they witness first-hand Verone’s persuasive interrogative techniques which involve a bucket and a frantic rat. I feel confident in stating that this is not a regular occurrence at thePearl Champagne Lounge,1 Ocean Driveat 1st Street,South Miami Beach, where the scene was shot.\nThe festering differences between Roman and Brian are quietly settled in front of a glowing sunset onPigeon Key, a tiny island on theFlorida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail, west ofMarathon. The Trail, now closed to traffic, was the old 7 Mile Bridge, where the helicopter/limo chase forJames Cameron'sTrue Lies, withArnold Schwarzenegger, were filmed (a new Seven Mile Bridge now runs alongside).\nThe meet-up with Verone’s men for the big job is onSW 8th Streetin front ofVersailles Restaurant,3555 SW 8th Street,East Coral Gables– not far from the Little Havana district. Possibly the world’s most famous Cuban restaurant,Versailleshas been serving Cuban cuisine since 1971.\nThe cops’ carefully-planned stake-out is foiled when a fleet of countless cars bursts from a seemingly empty storage space. This has now been spruced up to become theMana Wynwood Production Village, 318 NW 23rd Street, a production venue in theWynwood Arts Districtnorth of Downtown. The entrance, with that elevated walkway, is onNW 5th Avenueat NW 22nd Street.\nThe airstrip in the Keys, to which the cops are diverted, is theDade Collier Training and Transition Center, something of a white elephant, once intended to be the 6-runway Everglades Jetport. Its single runway sits in the Big Cypress National Preserve, about 35 miles west of  downtownMiami,\nThe real destination is Verone’s boat which is berthed at what was, until closing in 2012, Jimbo’s, a legendary dive-bar onArthur Lamb Jr Road, on an inlet at the eastern end ofVirginia Key. It was run by a character calledJimbo Luznarfrom 1954 until he was obliged to close it down in 2012.\nFormally called Virginia Key Fishing Village, this locale has been a popular spot for filming – boasting a clutch of rickety cottages originally built for 1980 schlockerIsland Claws, the mutated crab movie co-written byRicou Browning(the one-time diver who played the original 1954The Creature From The Black Lagoon). Scenes forTrue Lies,Ace Ventura, Pet DetectiveandPorky’s 2were filmed here, along with countless Miami-based TV shows includingFlipper,Miami Vice,CSI Miami,Burn NoticeandDexter.\nThe shot of O’Conner’s car leaping onto the moving boat was filmed a few miles to the south on Key Biscayne, at the southern tip ofBill Baggs Cape Florida State Park,1200 South Crandon Boulevard, Key Biscayne, FL 33149(tel: 305.361.5811). A fishing pier was built to provide the ramp, while the car’s engine was removed and the vehicle steam-cleaned to prevent Biscayne Bay getting polluted by traces of oil or gas.\nAt the same time,Michael Baywas busy filmingBad Boys II(2003) over on the other side of the park.\nThe final resolution, with no empty pockets, is back at Jimbo’s inVirginia Key.\n", "locations": [{"name": "John Singleton", "address": "John Wesley Park, Singleton, Great Chart with Singleton, Great Chart, Ashford, Kent, England, United Kingdom", "latitude": 51.1343029, "longitude": 0.8415015, "descriptions": ["Discover whereJohn Singleton's2 Fast 2 Furious(2003) was filmed inMiamiand aroundFlorida."]}, {"name": "Miami", "address": "Miami, Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States", "latitude": 25.7741566, "longitude": -80.1935973, "descriptions": ["Discover whereJohn Singleton's2 Fast 2 Furious(2003) was filmed inMiamiand aroundFlorida.", "The airstrip in the Keys, to which the cops are diverted, is theDade Collier Training and Transition Center, something of a white elephant, once intended to be the 6-runway Everglades Jetport.

The deserted hospital, clearly intended to be ‘St Thomas’, across the Thames from Westminster, is a mix ofCentral Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, NW10and the closed Greenwich District Hospital, onWoolwich Road, Greenwich.\nIn an amazing feat of location shooting, early morning traffic was held up for brief moments over several days to capture awesome shots of an eerily empty city.\nJim crossesWestminster Bridgefrom the south bank toward theHouses of Parliament. Incidentally, it’s beneath the carved stone lion stone at the southern end of the bridge you’ll find the door that supposedly leads to the abandoned ‘Vauxhall Cross station’ – the HQ of MI6 inDie Another Day.\nWalking upWhitehall, he passes an overturned red bus (to minimise disruption, the double-decker bus was deftly positioned and removed within 15 minutes).Whitehall, which is home to major government buildings, is usually the centre of major panics – though often only in brief second unit shots. Masked demonstrators march down the street inV For Vendetta, and in three Bond movies –A View To A Kill,OctopussyandLicence To Kill– 007’s HQ was the Old War Office Building. The entrance to the Ministry of Magic is, naturally, just offWhitehallinHarry Potter And The Order of The PhoenixandHarry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1.\nJim trudges throughHorseguards Parade, and up theMallto theDuke of York’s Steps, where he finds now-useless money drifting about.\nThere's an odd detour into theCity of London, the historic centre which is some way to the east, past theBank of Englandand the oldRoyal Exchange, before Jim sets off a car alarm beneathCentre Point, atSt Giles CircusonTottenham Court Road. He begins to get an inkling of the catastrophe at the boarded-up ‘Eros’ fountain (more accurately, theShaftesbury Monument Memorial Fountain) inPiccadilly Circus.\nThe graffiti-scrawled church entrance (“The end is extremely fucking nigh”) isNicholas Hawksmoor’sSt Anne’s Church, Commercial Roadat Newell Street,Limehouse, where Jim is attacked by the raging priest.\nJim narrowly escapes a mob of the infected after a handful of survivors blow up a petrol station on theIsle of Dogs, the loop in the River Thames north of Greenwich, and most of the rest of theLondonfilming is down in the southeast.\nThe vast steel escalators atCanary Wharf tube stationlead down to the tracks of theDockland Light Railway, and a trek toDeptfordand the house of Jim's parents.\nThe tower block, which provides a temporary haven, was River Heights, onGlyndon Road, Plumstead, SE18. Due for demolition, it was pulled down shortly after filming.\nThe geography gets a bit wonky here, as the band stocks up on food at (now gone) Budgens supermarket, which stood at145 Tottenham Court Road, back in theWest End, before driving through theBlackwall Tunnel(running under the Thames) in order to reach Manchester, in the north.\nThe Blackwall entrance is real enough, but you can’t close down this main artery for long, and the rat pack fleeing the zombie horde was filmed in the much-newerLimehouse Link Tunnel, built to link the City with Docklands.\nSupposedly heading up the M1, to Manchester, the fugitives enjoy a brief countryside idyll down in the southwest, atWaverley Abbey, nearFarnhaminSurrey. The first Cistercian abbey, dating from 1128, it’s now administered byEnglish Heritage– and open to visit from April to September. You can see it again inShekhar Kapur’s historical epicElizabeth, The Golden Age, inEdgar Wright'sHot Fuzzand as the home of Rapunzel inRob Marshall's film ofStephen Sondheim'sInto The Woods.\nAnd, far from Manchester, the army HQ isTrafalgar Park, about five miles south ofSalisburyinWiltshire. The country house isn’t open to the public, but you can hire it for weddings or corporate events. You can seeTrafalgaragain in the 1995 film ofSense And Sensibility.\nBut it's on to the real north of England for the ending, which was shot on Forestry Commission land atEnnerdale Water, between Cockermouth and Egremont in theCumbria’s beautifulLake District.\n", "locations": [{"name": "Stuttgart", "address": "Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Deutschland", "latitude": 48.7784485, "longitude": 9.1800132, "descriptions": ["The ‘Cambridge Primate Research Centre’, where activists release monkeys infected with the Rage virus, had to be filmed inStuttgart,Germany, where one of only two troupes of suitable chimps was found."]}, {"name": "Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, NW10", "address": "Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, Park Royal, London Borough of Ealing, Greater London, England, NW10 7NS, United Kingdom", "latitude": 51.5313189, "longitude": -0.2677643, "descriptions": ["The movie proper kicks off inLondon, where Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes from a coma to discover himself seemingly the sole inhabitant of the capital.

The survivors flit around the city randomly. It's the look of the locations that matters not geographical accuracy.\nLike the previous film, it was based atThree Mills Studios,Three Mill Lane, inEastLondon, not too far north from theIsle of Dogswhere much of the film is set.\nIt starts out, though, with a prologue in the countryside north ofLondonwhere married couple Don (Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) are holed up with a handful of other survivors in a remote farm. This place is old favouriteStockers Farm,Stockers Farm RoadoffHarefield RoadinRickmansworth,Hertfordshire.\nThis was previously seen as the isolated farm in which the title song is recorded in the 2018Freddie MercurybiopicBohemian Rhapsody, as well as having appeared inAlfonso Cuarón's dystopianChildren of Men, 2010'sNever Let Me Go,Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reasonand many other films and TV shows. It's private property and inaccessible to the public.\nWhen the infected inevitably descend on the farm, Don alone escapes in terror – riddled with guilt at leaving Alice behind.\nSome months later, the plague seems to have subsided. The infected have died from starvation, mainland Britain is deserted and the first group of healthy evacuees are tentatively returned to a quarantined safe zone called 'District 1', supervised by a US-led NATO force.\n'District 1' is theIsle of Dogs. It's not an island but a peninsula – a huge bite taken out ofEastLondonby a horseshoe-shaped meander in theRiver Thames. TheIsleis home to theCanary Wharf Docklandsdevelopment,London's financial hub since the 1980s and packed with modern office buildings.\nWith these high-rise blocks giving excellent surveillance for the army and with water on three sides, it's an ideal containment site.\nAerial shots show the plane carrying the new arrivals landing atLondon City Airport, which is indeed only just a couple of miles east of theIsle of Dogs.28 Weeks Later film location: the interior of 'London City Airport': Stansted Airport, EssexOnce on the ground, the airport on-screen becomesStansted Airport,Bassingbourn Road,Stansted, inEssexabout 40 miles northeast ofLondon. A regular cinematic go-to,Stanstedoften stands for other airports in films such asBridget Jones's Diary(as New York's JFK),Spider-Man: Far From Home(as Newark, New Jersey) and even inThe Dark Knight Rises(as Gotham International). The usually busy traffic of this international airport had to be removed digitally.The area around theIsle of Dogsis served by theDLR(Docklands Light Railway) which smoothly whisks the newcomers past the streets ofSilvertown, where the military are still clearing houses of potentially hazardous waste, and past theO2 Arena(formerly the Millennium Dome), to their new home.Among them are Don's two children Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), who are reunited with their Dad as they arrive atCanary Wharf DLR Station. They discover he's become a senior member of the team overseeing the resettlement.Although there are wide shots and aerial views ofCanary Wharf, most of the 'District 1' area is largely filmed aroundCityPointhighrise onRopemaker StreetE2, near Moorgate tube station.You may recognise the buildings' striking 'eyelid' entrance as the 'IOS HQ' in 'Columbus, Ohio' inSteven Spielberg'sReady Player One, or fromWoody Allen'sScoop, withHugh Jackman. Its lobby also became the entrance to the glitzy 'Gotham City' restaurant where Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), in full-on playboy mode, rolls up with two women on his arms inChristopher Nolan'sBatman Begins.Much of the subsequent action sequences take place in the open piazza in front ofCityPoint.Despite all precautions the two children, missing their old home and wanting to retrieve a photograph of their mother whom they believe dead, abscond from the safe zone, furtively crossingSouth Quay Footbridgecrossing theSouth Dock.28 Weeks Later film location: Tammy and Andy abscond from 'District 1': Woodstock Terrace, Poplar, London E14 |Photograph:Google MapsThe geography is immediately off-kilter. Despite escaping through the southern border of the safe zone, they immediately find themselves running along desertedPoplar High StreetandWoodstock Terrace, E14, north of theIsle of Dogs.28 Weeks Later film location: Tammy and Andy suddenly find themselves in North London: Crouch Hill, London N4It gets crazier. Within a minute, they've crossed the whole ofLondonto find themselves way up inCrouch End, N4. Here they discover the abandoned moped outside a pizza house, from which Tammy manages to retrieve its keys. This was Casa Bella Pizzeria, which became Delicate Gastrobar but (as of February 2025) now seems to be closed,30 Crouch Hillthe corner of Japan Crescent just east of Crouch Hill rail station.28 Weeks Later film location: Tammy and Andy discover the abandoned scooter: Crouch Hill, London N4Nevertheless, they're soon racing the moped south acrossTower Bridge(all cinematic road journeys inLondonare obliged to crossTower Bridgeno matter where they're headed) and then passing theCity of London's famousGherkinhigh rise office block (which is back north of the bridge). OK, I'll stop pointing out the discrepancies. Just go with it.28 Weeks Later film location: Tammy and Andy come across the abandoned cars: Sandringham Road, Dalston, London E8 |Photograph:Google MapsThey negotiate the abandoned cars left at the crossroads ofSt Mark's RiseandSandringham RoadinDalston, E8. Coincidentally, in the background stands the house occupied by Johnny (David Thewlis) inMike Leigh's scabrous1993 dramaNaked.From here, they zoom quickly throughEast Ham Jewish Cemetery,Marlow Road E6. A bit of trivia, this is the last resting place ofAaron Kozminsky, one of the handful of suspects dubiously claimed to have been the killer in countless \"The Real Jack the Ripper\" TV documentaries.28 Weeks Later film location: Tammy and Andy visit their old home: Therapia Road, Honor Oak, London SE22Their destination is32 Therapia RoadinHonor Oak, the old family home where Tammy and Andy discover their mother is still alive. If you're visiting the area, it's only a few minutes away from the cemetery with the old Gothic house used in the 1969 film adaptation ofJoe Orton's dark farceEntertaining Mr Sloane.28 Weeks Later film location: 'District 1 Medical Centre' s: Thomas More Square, Wapping, London E1 |Photograph:Google MapsTraced and taken back to quarantine, Tammy, Andy and Alice are held in 'District 1 Medical Centre', which isTrinity Tower,Thomas More Squareoff Vaughan Way,Wapping,LondonE1. This was whereJude Lawworked inMike Nichols' film ofPatrick Marber's playCloserand was also the HQ of 'Renham Industries' in TV'sThe IT Crowd.When Don visits his wife here, an unwise kiss leads to dire consequences. With the Rage back and the area put into lockdown, panicked people spill out intoThomas More Square, where army snipers are tasked with attempting to recognise and take out the infected.The shot of the bodies lying on the ground after the massacre is back at the open piazza in front ofCityPointonRopemaker Street.Now teamed up with army sniper Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and medic Scarlet (Rose Byrne) the kids need to escape as 'Code Red' – extermination – is put into force.With 'District 1' being intensively firebombed, the four escape through theGreenwich Foot Tunnel, running beneath theThames, just avoiding incineration as they pop out of the domed tunnel exit alongside theCutty Sarksailing ship displayed inGreenwich.28 Weeks Later film location: the survivors make there way through Borough: Stoney Street, Borough, London SE1 |Photograph:Google MapsA moment later they're passing under the railway arch onStoney Street, alongsideBorough Market, then crossing theMillennium BridgetowardSt Paul's Cathedral.A horde of the infected have already made it as far asSmithfield EC1where they rampage through the central arcade of the oldSmithfield Marketbuilding.28 Weeks Later film location: the escaped infected pour through the market: Smithfield Market, London SE1But by now our survivors have reached theWest End, and are heading alongShaftesbury Avenuepast theApolloandLyric Theatresand the corner ofGreat Windmill StreettowardPiccadilly Circus.Passing throughTrafalgar Square, they somehow manage to arrive at 'Regent's Park' in northwestLondon.In fact, the overgrown park with its abandoned funfair where they're due to rendezvous with the 'copter, is the grounds ofKnebworth HousenearStevenageinHertfordshire. The grand Victorian neo-Gothic mansion, obviously not shown, is a regular screen star fromTim Burton's 1989Batman,  theIngrid Bergman1956 Oscar-winnerAnastasia, 2010 Oscar-winnerThe King's SpeechwithColin Firth, biopicWildewithStephen Fry,Ken Russell's kitschyLair of the White Worm(with a pre-stardomHugh Grant),Gene Wilder'sHaunted Honeymoonand the deliriously daft schlockerHorror Hospital.With the sudden arrival of the infected, the 'copter is unable to touch down and the survivors decide to rendezvous on the pitch ofWembley Stadium, home of English football, where a safe landing is more likely.Commandeering an abandoned car, they end up back south ofTrafalgar SquareinWestminster, roaring alongGreat Scotland Yard. Maybe they're looking for help from the Ministry of Magic which was situated here inHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix? Whatever, they're suddenly down at the southern end ofWhitehallheading back north, when they're attacked with gunfire from a military helicopter. This being the very security-conscious heart of British government, the 'copter and the carnage it creates alongWhitehallare entirely digital.28 Weeks Later film location: the survivors pursued by the 'copter': Whitehall, SW1Now it's down into the underground system atCharing Cross Station, and its disused Jubilee Line escalators and platforms. These are often used as a film location, since it causes no disruption to everyday tube travel. Until 1999, this was the southern terminus of the Jubilee Line but, with the development of Docklands, the line's proposed route was changed to run south from Green Park and the Charing Cross platforms were closed.This part of the station is still maintained, though off-limits to the public, used to try out new design ideas, to audition buskers (who need a licence to perform within the tube system) and – importantly – as a film location, seen inThe Bourne Ultimatum,SkyfallandMorbiusamong many other productions.The rail tunnel through which they run, though, is the much older and completely closedAldwych Stationon theStrandatSurrey Street WC2.To visit both of these normally off-limits stations, you can take one ofLondon Transport Museum's occasionalHidden Londontours.From the tunnel, they mysteriously emerge into the light at the entrance to the newWembley Stadium(which wasn't actually completed at the time the film is set),South Way, Wembley, north ofLondon.The overgrown pitch, though, from which they are finally picked up, is that ofCardiff'sPrincipality Stadium(formerly Millennium Stadium) theNational Stadium of WalesinCardiff, with a little digital tweaking. The stadium appears again inKingsman: The Golden Circleand in 2001 Hindi smashKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...The downbeat epilogue was a last minute addition, filmed guerrilla-style inPariswith 12 extras at 5am: theEiffel Towerseen from thePalais de Chaillot.\nOnce on the ground, the airport on-screen becomesStansted Airport,Bassingbourn Road,Stansted, inEssexabout 40 miles northeast ofLondon.

Find out where.\nThe strictly-quarantined island on which a group of survivors has developed a successful, almost Medieval, culture isLindisfarne, off the coast ofNorthumberland.\nAlso known asHoly Island, it was an important centre of Celtic Christianity, home to a monastery founded by Saint Aidan.\nYes, it is joined to the mainland by a causeway which is only traversable during low tide. If you're visiting, the causeway is generally open from about three hours after high tide until two hours before the next high tide. There are warning signs to check tide times and the weather, and to keep to the marked path. For drivers, tide tables are displayed at both ends of the causeway.\nNevertheless, about one vehicle each month gets stranded on the causeway.\nThe nearest railway station isBerwick-on-Tweedand from there, it's about nine miles south to the tiny village ofBeal, from where the island is signposted.\nUnderstandably, there was no filming on the causeway itself, we can assume that drone shots and effects were used for the crossing scenes.\nRelegated to the background, we see little of the island's most famous landmark,Lindisfarne Castle, which is what is more usually seen on screen, in twoRoman Polanskifilms, the 1966 dark comedyCul-de-Sacand his 1971 adaptation ofMacbeth.\n12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams) is deemed old enough by his Dad (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) for his first trip to the mainland to learn to cope with the infected inhabitants. They're cheered off by locals as walk through the island's only town, alongFenkle Streetpast theMarket Crossand theManor House Hotel.\nAlthough this is the realLindisfarne,  the interior of the 'Holy Island Mission' with its wooden beams and 'barrel'-style ceiling, where the locals gather is theJubilee HallinNewton-on-the-Moor, five miles south ofAlnwickinNorthumberland.\nOn the mainland, the lush woodland where, equipped with bow and arrow Spike must experience his first kill, isKielder Forest. About 30 miles northwest of Hexham inNorthumberland, this is the largest man-made plantation in England and within it standsKielder Water, a large artificial reservoir which we'll be seeing later.\nThe pair end up stranded and spend the night in an abandoned farmhouse, but the smoke from a distant fire alerts Spike to the fact that there's another uninfected inhabitant of the mainland.\nOnce safely back onLindisfarne, Spike learns that this is probably Dr Kelson (Ralph Fiennes), dismissed as a mad hermit. With his mother (Jodie Comer) seriously ill and getting worse, Spike is determined to take her to the mainland for what may be her only hope of cure.\nWhile his Dad and the other islanders are distracted, Spike and his Mum cross the causeway and carefully make their way toward where Dr Kelson seems to live.\nThe journey rather poignantly takes them through what is known asSycamore Gap, a hollow alongsideHadrian's Wall, nearCrag LoughinNorthumberland, in which stood a lone 150-year-old sycamore tree.\nSadly it's no more. This much loved and photographed landmark was illegally chopped down one night in 2023 by a pair of idiotic vandals for no apparent reason.\nYou might have seen the tree as it used to be inRobin Hood, Prince of Thieves.\nThe two pass the night in the ruins ofFountains Abbey, about three miles southwest ofRiponinNorth Yorkshire. This was a Cistercian monastery, founded in 1132, which fell victim to the Dissolution of the Monasteries by King Henry VIII in 1539. It's now aWorld Heritage Site, owned by theNational Trust.\nThe ruins were used for the climax ofOmen III: The Final Conflictin 1980, as well as being seen in both the 1993 and 2020 screen versions ofThe Secret Gardenand in the 2006 film adaptation ofAlan Bennett'sThe History Boys, withRichard Griffiths. TheAbbeyhad previously been the main setting forBennett's first TV play,A Grand Day Out, in 1972.\nSpike and his Mum also pass theAngel of the North,Antony Gormley's 65-feet-tall steel statue which has stood alongside the A1 just south ofGateshead,Tyne & Wear, since 1998.\nA side quest sees a squad of stranded Swedish NATO soldiers falling victim to the infected as they make their way through the spillway ofKielder Water Hydroelectric Facility, the largest hydroelectric plant inEngland, at the northeast tip ofKielder Water.\nThe only survivor of the group is Eric (Edvin Ryding) who goes on to save Spike and his Mum when they are trapped by the infected in an old 'Happy Eater' cafe and filling station ('Happy Eater' was a popular chain of cheap'n'cheerful roadside eateries in the 1970s which had been taken over in 1996).\nThis is a real though disused and dilapidated branch, which was still standing alongside theKnowesgate Hotelon the A696 atKnowesgate, about 22 miles northwest ofNewcastle-Upon-Tyne. It was redressed for the production, and I love that the 'S' of the Shell serving station has disappeared.\nFrom here the three of them stumble upon an abandoned and overgrown railway train, where one of the infected is giving birth.\nThis is an old Class 31 Diesel locomotive which was hired for the production and filmed on theEmbsay & Bolton Abbey Steam Railway, a stretch of the old Midland Railway running as a heritage railway for four miles fromEmbsaytoBolton Abbey, east of Skipton inNorth Yorkshire.\nThey finally reach Dr Kelson's encampment and its bizarre Memento Mori, the 'Bone Temple' construction of human bones and skulls.\nThe collection of more than 250,000 artificial bones and 5,500 skulls took the production team more than six months to assemble into those columns, on grassland alongside theRiver Ure, just south of the village ofRedmire, about 4 miles west of Leyburn in Wensleydale in the Yorkshire Dales,North Yorkshire.\nKeeping spoilers to the minimum for now, Spike eventually decides it's time to put his survival skills to use and strike out on his own. He has quite a journey, traversingEnglandnorth to south in the cinematic blink of an eye.\nThe road twisting between sheer cliffs, is the B3135 winding its way through famousCheddar Gorgein theMendip Hills, near the village ofCheddar, about nine miles northwest of Wells inSomerset. And, yes this is where Cheddar Cheese originated.\nIf you're visiting the area, remember that Wells was the city transformed into 'Sandford' forEdgar Wright's 2007Hot Fuzz.\nAlmost outnumbered by the infected, Spike's salvation comes in a form as unexpected as it's been controversial (the last line of my notes scribbled in the cinema on first viewing simply reads \"WTF?\")\n", "locations": [{"name": "Britain", "address": "Great Britain, United Kingdom", "latitude": 54.3151594, "longitude": -1.9181532, "descriptions": ["Danny Boyle's long awaited second sequel to his groundbreaking sort-of-zombie movie creates a disturbing post-apocalypticBritainfrom a patchwork of locations largely around northeastEngland.

He’s getting sandwiches from theLexington Candy Shop Luncheonette,1226 Lexington Avenueon the corner of East 83rd Street. It’s worth the six-block walk. This Manhattan institution dating from 1925 which, amazingly, continues virtually unchanged,is the oldest luncheonette in New York City. It continues to serve up traditional American fare,  and its interior hasn’t been updated since 1948.\nWarned by his CIA contact not to speak to anyone or return to his home, Turner finds himself terrifyingly alone in Manhattan.\nHis first instinct is to blend into the anonymity of the crowds at the nearbyGuggenheim Museum,1071 Fifth Avenue. The huge white spiral, opened in 1959 and designed byFrank Lloyd Wright, houses a vast collection of mainly non-representational modern art. It dominates 5th Avenue, opposite Central Park at 89th Street and features on-screen again inMen In BlackandTom Tykwer’s 2009 thrillerThe International.\nOne other member of the team, Heidegger, had been absent from the office at the time of the killings. In frustration, and ignoring advice, Turner goes to check on Heidegger at hisUpper West Sideapartment,20 West 71st Streetnear Central Park West. He finds Heidegger dead and only narrowly avoids a couple of spooks who are also sniffing around.\nEven more recklessly, he sneaks back to his ownChelseaapartment,485 West 22nd Streetat 10th Avenue, only to be tipped off by an unwitting neighbour that “two friends are already waiting for him”.\nAfter a couple of hours, as instructed, he rings the agency and speaks to a CIA controller called Higgins (Cliff Robertson).\nThere’s a level of poignancy that couldn’t have been contemplated in 1975 when it turns out Higgins’ office is in One World Trade Center, North Tower, with its amazing view down to the Empire State Building.\nThe twin towers appear on the skyline of countless films butThree Days Of The Condoris one of the few, if not the only one, to film inside the towers. Here the monoliths are used to represent the all-seeing, yet anonymous institutions of national security hiding in plain sight.\nHiggins, whom Turner has never met, arranges a meeting to bring him in at the alleyway which runs behind the landmarkAnsoniabuilding,2109 Broadway, between West 72nd and West 73rd Streets on theUpper West Side. The elaborateAnsoniaitself is famous from 1992 thrillerSingle White Femaleand the 1975 film ofNeil Simon'sThe Sunshine Boys.\nAlthough usually deserted alleys like this are commonplace inLA-set movies, they’re much rarer in space-consciousNew York, which is why this one was chosen for the film.\nTurner sits waiting on the steps of251 West 73rd Streetalongside the alley until the appointed time. Of course, the rendezvous turns out to be a trap and Turner is lucky to escape with his life.\nNow totally isolated, his desperation forces him to abduct a total stranger, Kathy Hale (Faye Dunaway) from outside a clothing store onBroadway at 76th Streetand demand to be taken to her home.\nThe terrified Kathy is forced at gunpoint to drive over theBrooklyn Bridgeto her place in the basement at9 Cranberry Street, Brooklyn Heights(which would make her a neighbour ofCherin 1987’sMoonstruck, who lived a few doors along at number 19).\nAs Turner tries to figure out what the hell is going on, there develops an uneasy relationship which sees him both leaving Kathy tied up in the bathroom for long periods of time and enjoying apparently consensual sex with her.\nIn true Hitchcockian fashion, Kathy is eventually convinced by Turner’s unlikely story and agrees to help him. Inveigling her way into the WTC, Kathy manages to find Higgins’ office and get a glimpse of the mysterious agent.\nNow able to recognise Turner’s remote controller, she confronts him at what was McCoy’s restaurant, and is nowEPasta,20 Maiden Lane, in theFinancial District. Convinced that the unseen Turner has a gun trained on him, Higgins is forced to exit the restaurant only to find himself unceremoniously bundled into a car and whisked off to a seemingly remote and deserted riverfront.\nThis isWards Island, across theHarlem Riverfrom East Harlem. On the shore of the island’s southern tip, alongside theWard’s Island Footbridge, Higgins reluctantly reveals that the assassin is Joubert (Max Von Sydow), a freelance hitman occasionally employed to do the agency’s dirty work.\nTurner traces the chillingly matter-of-fact killer to what was the Holiday Inn, now theWatson Hotel,440 West 57th Streetat 9th Avenue on the West Side, where he uses his particular skillset to intercept Joubert’s phone calls.\nJoubert, it turns out, has been hired by a rogue agent in Maryland, called Atwood, and it’s time for Turner to take a trip away from the city.\nHe says his goodbyes to Kathy at the splendid oldHoboken Railway Station, Hoboken, across the Hudson River inNew Jersey. Photogenic enough to have appeared inFunny Girl,Once Upon A Time In AmericaandKal Ho Naa Ho, the terminal suffered flood damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012 but has happily been restored.\nAtwood’s ‘Maryland’ mansion is in reality no further away than one of the grand estates onLong Island, and it's here Turner finally pieces together the convoluted plot.\nNow the standard device of every American political thriller, the imperative to take control of Middle Eastern oil resources was a shockingly new idea in 1975.\nTurner arranges one last meeting, and it’s outside the old offices of theNew York Times,229 West 43rd Street, that he reveals to a horrified Higgins that the whole account of CIA machinations has been leaked to the press.\nIn teasingly ambiguous style, the film ends on the unanswered question, will theNYTprint the story?\n", "locations": [{"name": "55 East 77th Street", "address": "55, East 77th Street, Upper East Side, Manhattan Community Board 8, Manhattan, New York County, City of New York, New York, 10075, United States", "latitude": 40.7749587, "longitude": -73.9624806, "descriptions": ["They work, under the innocuous guise of the ‘American Literary Historical Society’, out of the elaborate 1902 Beaux Arts house at55 East 77th Streetat Madison Avenue onNew York'sEast Side."]}, {"name": "East Side", "address": "East Side, Chicago, Hyde Park Township, Cook County, Illinois, United States", "latitude": 41.7135693, "longitude": -87.5327809, "descriptions": ["They work, under the innocuous guise of the ‘American Literary Historical Society’, out of the elaborate 1902 Beaux Arts house at55 East 77th Streetat Madison Avenue onNew York'sEast Side."]}, {"name": "1226 Lexington Avenue", "address": "Caligor Pharmacy, 1226, Lexington Avenue, Upper East Side, Manhattan Community Board 8, Manhattan, New York County, City of New York, New York, 10037, United States", "latitude": 40.7774348, "longitude": -73.9572738, "descriptions": ["Fortuitously for Turner, the massacre occurs while he’s briefly sneaked out of the building’s rear entrance.

He drives downVallejointo the city where his day is about to go badly wrong.\nHe joins a couple of other 'tecs in searching the sleazy 'Walden Hotel' – which turns out to be the one in which Ganz and Billy are holed up. In reality, this was once a high-end hotel inNob HillwhereSan Franciscohigh society clubs would gather. Built in 1911, it was the first luxury residential building to rise after the 1906 earthquake. It's now the rather smartKeystone Apartments, 1369 Hyde Streetat Washington Street.\nWhen Ganz escapes after having shot one of the cops dead with Cates' gun, the case becomes personal.\nThe premise of the plot involves Cates getting – not strictly by the book – a former pal of Luther released from prison for 48 hours to help track down the bad guys.\nTo this end, Cates drives across theRichmond-San Rafael Bridgetoward the notoriousSan Quentin Prison, which we can see in the distance. But that's as close as we get.\nOnce he arrives, we're suddenly inLos Angeles. The corridors and cells are those of dependable oldLincoln Heights Jail, 401 North Avenue 19, Lincoln Heights– a long-closed facility that's become a regular screen lock-up from the 1954A Star Is Born(the drunk tank in whichJames Masonis kept) toA Nightmare on Elm Street(for which it supplied the boiler room).\nCates signs out the feisty Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) who soon leads him – in the realSan Francisco– to Luther's place,65-67 Woodward Streetat 14th Street, in theMission District, where Luther's attempt to make a run for it is stopped when he crashes full into a car door smart opened by Hammond.\nThe ill-matched pair set off to visit a redneck bar inSan Francisco's 'Mission District' where Billy sometimes worked behind the bar, but the exit ramp from the cop station up which they drive is another familiarLAlocation, onGrand Streetat the rear of theMillennium Biltmore Hotel,DowntownLA(that's the Biltmore which became the 'Beverly Palms Hotel' whereEddie Murphystayed inBeverly Hills Cop).\nIt's not too far from the Biltmore to the 'Mission' bar, also inDowntownLA. This was Torchy's,218 1/2 West Fifth Street, which closed years ago. In fact, when I first visited in 1996, it had already been converted into an electrical goods store. It currently seems to be closed but amazingly, despite all its incarnations over the years, the ridged frontage where the 'Torchy's' illuminated sign hung, is still recognisable.\nIt stands in a busy part of town for filming, standing alongside the Alexandria Hotel (John Doe's place inSe7en) and oppositeN'Bushe Wright's apartment inBlade.\nGetting a tip-off about Billy's girlfriend living in Chinatown, that's their next stop. But it'sLos Angeles'sChinatown, and the stretch ofChung King Roadseen in the big-screenStarsky & Hutchand as 'Hong Kong' inEverything Everywhere All the Time.\nThe festering friction between Cates and Hammond finally erupts into a full-on fist fight on the corner ofWest 5th Street and South Broadway. It's soon broken up, by the cops and in true Hollywood style, the many loud thuds to the face leave no trace but a slight trickle of blood on Cates' chin.\nHaving sort-of cleared the air, they clean up in the washroom of the garage was the old Gilmore Gas station,859 North Highland Avenueat Willoughby Avenue, south of Santa Monica Boulevard inHollywood. You might recognise the 1935 landmark fromLA Story, withSteve Martin. It's been preserved and lives on now as a stylish branch of Starbucks.\nHammond fesses up that he holds the money everyone is looking for, stashed in the trunk of his car for the past three years in the Allright Parking Garage in Bunker Hill – pretty much where California Plaza now stands, an area of DowntownLArendered unrecognisable by radical redevelopment.\nLuther gets there first and makes off with both car and loot, quickly arriving back in the realSan Franciscowhere he's chased intoChurch Street StationatMarket Streetto meet with Ganz and Billy. The pair manage to board a train as Cates is frustratingly detained by cops.\nWe're soon back toLAwhere Ganz has commandeered a bus leading them on a chase through the familiar streets ofDowntownbefore, once again, getting away.\nAfter the traditional bawling out by his superior at the station, Cates is ordered to escort Hammond immediately back to prison.\nAs if that's going to happen.\nThe cop station they're seen exiting isLA'sHall of Justice, 211 West Temple Street, north of City Hall. Of course Cates and Hammond squeeze in one last – and successful – attempt to pin down the bad guys back inChinatown.\nNo, there's no sudden pardon for Hammond after all his work and it's back to prison – although Cates slyly allows him to keep the cash in his car and even permits him a little rest and recreation with the woman he met in a bar earlier.\nHer apartment, where the film ends, was the Engstrum Apartments,623 West 5th Street. As I said, this area of DowntownLAhas been seriously redeveloped and the site where her apartment stood is now occupied by the US Bank Tower (although the old Edison building alongside still remains).\nSo ignore the road sign forSan Francisco's Bay Bridge as they drive off into the night back along 5th Street – with the rear ofLA'sMillennium Biltmore Hotelin the background.\n", "locations": [{"name": "Warnerville", "address": "Warnerville, Town of Richmondville, Schoharie County, New York, 12043, United States", "latitude": 42.6603531, "longitude": -74.507363, "descriptions": ["The prologue sets up Ganz (James Remar) being violently sprung from a prison work gang by his criminal associate Billy Bear (Sonny Landham), which was filmed on theSierra RailroadatWarnerville, about 20 miles northeast of Modesto,California."]}, {"name": "450-452 Vallejo Street", "address": "Vallejo Street, Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California, 90031, United States", "latitude": 34.0707459, "longitude": -118.2159091, "descriptions": ["They're about to cross paths with Det Cates (Nick Nolte) who's presently dealing with balancing the needs of his job with those of his girlfriend Elaine (Annette O'Toole) while he's staying at her place,450-452 Vallejo Streetat the top ofVallejo StairsinNorth Beach.

It’s theA&L Mobile Home Park, 20785 Schultes Avenue, on the north side ofEast 8 Mile Road.\nTaking inspiration from the grim vistas of inner-city decay, Rabbit scribbles lyrics down as he rides the bus fromSchultes Avenuealong8 Mile Road(though the shots were taken alongChene Street).\nHe spends his days producing ‘crash parts’ at theNew Center Stamping Plant, 950 East Milwaukee Streetat Hastings Street.\nAt night, B-Rabbit tests his skills competing in rap battles held in a club called the Shelter. Although Shelter is real (andEminemstarted out here), in the basement beneath St Andrew’s Hall, 431 East Congress Street, it was recreated for the movie in a warehouse at240 Chene Street, a little to the east in the Rivertown Warehouse District.30 Clifford Street, a few blocks northwest of Shelter, was quite extensively dressed to provide the club exterior.\nAnd, just to complicate matters, backstage areas were filmed in an abandoned Rite Aid store at1120 Griswold Streetin the centre of downtownDetroit.\nA few blocks east of the ‘Shelter’ exterior, at1435 Randolph Street, stood Intermezzo, the restaurant at which Alex (Brittany Murphy) waited tables. It’s since closed.\nRabbit and his Three One Third crew hang out, and come on to the ladies, in the old Chin Tiki Club, which stood at2121 Cass Street, downtown. Filming here encouraged speculation that the popular hangout from the Fifties and Sixties, which had been closed for nearly twenty years, might reopen. Its subsequent demolition put an end to the hopes.\nStill surviving, alongside the empty lot where the Chin Tiki stood, is the strangely elaborate parking garage where Three One Third face off against rival rappers The Free World. This is theMichigan Building, 220 Bagley Streetat Grand River Avenue.\nBuilt in 1926 as the 4000-seat Michigan Theatre, an opulent concert hall-movie palace, it followed the career path of many fading grand theatres – becoming a nightclub before finally closing in the mid-Seventies. Unlike most of those theatres, though, the building was gutted to provide parking space for offices on the floors above. Its photogenically decaying plasterwork graces the screen again inMichael Bay’s sci-fi thriller,The Island.\nThere was a bit of controversy when it came to the scene of Rabbit and his mates torching the house in which a girl had supposedly been raped. Fearing for the city’s image, permission was initially refused, but an agreement was finally reached and122 Beresford Street, inHighland Park, was duly burned. By the way, the site is just a few blocks away from Walt Kowalski’s house inGran Torino.\nNorthwest of downtown, Rabbit angrily confronts the Free World and, in the ensuing ruckus, Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones) somehow manages to shoot himself in the leg. The fight is on the empty lot on the northwest corner ofGrand River AvenueandQuincy Streetin the uninvitingly run-downPetosky-Otsegoneighbourhood.\nThe home of Cheddar, where he understandably lies low after the accident, is1250 McClellan Streetat Jefferson Avenue, inEnglish Village, east of downtown.\nWith the promise of a career break from fixer Wink (Eugene Byrd), Rabbit turns up at the ‘WJLB’ radio station, which is housed in the landmark 1928 art decoPenobscot Building, 645 Griswold Street, downtown. What he finds there doesn’t further his ambitions one bit.\nAfter finally winning out at the Shelter, it’s directly opposite the club exterior onClifford Street, that Rabbit finally turns down the offer to host rap battles, and heads off down the alleyway alongsideGriswold Streetto take his one opportunity.\n", "locations": [{"name": "Detroit", "address": "Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, United States", "latitude": 42.3315509, "longitude": -83.0466403, "descriptions": ["Discover the locations aroundDetroitwhere8 Milewas made – “Filmed on location in the 313”, the area code for the inner city – including the trailer park, the clubs, the stamping plant where B-Rabbit worked, and the amazing parking garage setting for the rap battle.", "Jimmy Smith Jr, aka B-Rabbit (Eminem) struggles to escape a dead-end life in the star’s home town ofDetroit.", "As the end credits proudly announce, the movie was “Filmed on location in the 313”, the area code for inner urbanDetroit, traditionally separated from the posher northern suburbs by the titular8 Mile Road.", "And, just to complicate matters, backstage areas were filmed in an abandoned Rite Aid store at1120 Griswold Streetin the centre of downtownDetroit."]}, {"name": "8 Mile", "address": "8 Mile, Port Moresby, National Capital District, Southern Region, 135, Papua Niugini", "latitude": -9.4001242, "longitude": 147.2097018, "descriptions": ["Discover the locations aroundDetroitwhere8 Milewas made – “Filmed on location in the 313”, the area code for the inner city – including the trailer park, the clubs, the stamping plant where B-Rabbit worked, and the amazing parking garage setting for the rap battle."]}, {"name": "8 Mile Road", "address": "8 Mile Road, Pembroke, Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, 48221, United States", "latitude": 42.4456854, "longitude": -83.160316, "descriptions": ["As the end credits proudly announce, the movie was “Filmed on location in the 313”, the area code for inner urbanDetroit, traditionally separated from the posher northern suburbs by the titular8 Mile Road.", "And right on8 Mile Roaditself, in the suburb ofWarren, is ‘8 Mile Mobile Court’, the trailer park where Rabbit is obliged to move in with his wayward mother (Kim Basinger) after splitting up with his girlfriend.

After all these years, the film remains the epitome ofRive Gauchecool and the director is an acknowledged influence onQuentin Tarantino.\nThe Left Bank hotel of Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg), the riverfront Hotel de Suede – as it was in 1959 – lies in the shadow ofNotre Damecathedral, and was used as a make-do studio for most of the film’s interiors. One of the film’s sites that’s been given a substantial revamp and, with an eye to its location, a change of name,Les Rives de Notre Dame, 15 quai St Michelcan be found at the junction ofrue Xavier Privas(metro: St Michel).\nThe café, where Michel orders a breakfast he can’t afford, is now a drugstore. It was Le Royale St Germain, at the intersection of theboulevard St Germainand therue de Rennesopposite the St Germain des Pres metro station.\nWannabe-journalist Patricia is out selling theNew York Herald Tribuneon theChamps Elysées, where Michel catches up with her. The old office of the Trib, out of which Patricia works, has undergone a major facelift (it now houses a pensions company), but the brass plaque to the left of the doorway still records that from 1930 to 1978 this was the paper’s home. In front of the office, DirectorGodardhimself puts in a cameo appearance as the weaselly snitch who tips off the law. You can see the new frontage just off theArc de Triompheend of the Champs, at21 rue de Berri(metro: George V).\nMuch of the subsequent action centres around theChamps Elysées. The entrances to theGeorge V Métro stationitself are where Michel gives the slip to the detectives before striking poses in front ofHumphrey Bogartstills in a movie house lobby. The much-modernised cinema is theCinema Normandie, 116 bis Champs Elysées, next to the Lido de Paris.\nAt the top of the Champs stood the Pergola, the spacious first floor café where Patricia meets journalist Van Doude, and southwest is theavenue Montaigne, home of Paris’ swishest designer stores. Here, in front of theChristian Diorstore,30 avenue Montaigne, Patricia dreams of posh frocks while Michel shows off his savvy, knowing that this was the place to make phone calls for free.\nBriefly leaving the city centre, Patricia interviews novelist M Parvulesco on the terrace of what was, in 1959, Paris’ main airport,Orly, about 45 minutes south of the city. ‘Parvulesco’, incidentally, is another director’s cameo, byJean-Pierre Melvillewho made the excellentAlain DelonthrillerLe Samourai(which shares some of this film’s locations).\nBack on the Champs, it’s Patricia’s turn to be tailed, through crowds watching a (real) visit ofGeneral de GaulleandPresident Eisenhowerto the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier beneath theArc de Triomphe.\nLike Michel, Patricia’s evasive action also ends, unsurprisingly, in a movie house. She leaves the cops flummoxed, ducking through theCinema Mac-Mahon, 5 avenue Mac-Mahon, just off L’Étoile, which is still very much in business, though sporting a slightly spruced-up frontage.\nThe night scenes shift south of the Seine to the pseud’s paradise that was theLeft Bank. Michel and Patricia take off forSt-Germainin a stolen car, taking time to admire the sparkling lights ofPlace de la Concordeen route.\nThey end up further south in the midst of the clutch of famously arty hangouts on theboulevard Montparnasseat its junction withboulevard Raspail(metro: Vavin). Of the two bars used as backdrop to the scene, The Kosmos, which stood at 101 boulevard Montparnasse, has closed, butLe Select, 99 boulevard Montparnasse, is still packing them in, as isLa Rotonde, which the couple drive past on the way to the haven of Zumbach’s girlfriend’s place.\nThis is the photographer’s apartment where the pair spend their last night, only a couple of blocks south of boulevard Montparnasse, at11 rue Campagne Première. Running northeast from boulevard Raspail, the quiet sidestreet has long been a magnet for artists.Modigliani,Miro,Picasso,Ernst,GiacomettiandKandinskyhave all, at some time, called it home.\nMichel makes his doomed attempt to outrun a police bullet down the centre of the red-brick road, ending up – literally breathless – at the southern T-junction ofrue Campagne-Première with boulevard Raspail(metro: Raspail).\nJames McBride's underrated 1983 remake ofBreathless, withRichard Gere, is set inLos Angeles.\n", "locations": [{"name": "Marseille", "address": "Marseille, Bouches-du-Rhône, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France métropolitaine, France", "latitude": 43.2961743, "longitude": 5.3699525, "descriptions": ["One of the groundbreaking films to escape the confines of the studio,A Bout de Soufflewas shot (apart from the opening scene of petty crook Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) hotwiring a car in the Vieux Port ofMarseille) on location on the streets ofParis."]}, {"name": "Paris", "address": "Paris, Île-de-France, France métropolitaine, France", "latitude": 48.8534951, "longitude": 2.3483915, "descriptions": ["One of the groundbreaking films to escape the confines of the studio,A Bout de Soufflewas shot (apart from the opening scene of petty crook Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) hotwiring a car in the Vieux Port ofMarseille) on location on the streets ofParis."]}, {"name": "St.-Germain", "address": "Saint-Germain, Lunéville, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Grand Est, France métropolitaine, 54290, France", "latitude": 48.4324928, "longitude": 6.3386744, "descriptions": ["CinematographerRaoul Coutard’s restless camera, trundled about on a wheelchair or hidden in a post-office cart, forsakes theclichéof cutely angledtoitslooming out of the mist for a hard-edged picture of darkly glittering nights around the bars ofSt.-Germainand bustling days on theChamps Elysées.

At the junction with the A409 you can’t miss the looming tower of theImmanuel College, 87-91 Elstree Road– a Victorian Gothic confection set in an 11-acre campus, that used to be the Rosary Priory High School, and before that, the Caldecote Towers Hotel.\nThe building can also be seen inTom SelleckactionerHigh Road to China, but there’ll be no more filming. Its grotesque charm has been sabotaged by some horribly inappropriate modern additions (rail: Elstree or Stanmore).\nThe cemetery in which Phibes and his wife were supposedly laid to rest is the overgrown and creepy old section ofHighgate Cemetery, on the west side ofSwain’s Lane,LondonN6.\nWhen centralLondon’s burial places had filled up in the 19th century, huge cemeteries were opened up on what were then the outskirts of town. Not famous for their quiet modesty in grave styling, the Victorians came up with one of the most gloriously extravagant.\nThe first grandiose monuments were erected in the West Cemetery in 1839, but by 1854 even that was filling up and the East Cemetery, on the other side ofSwain’s Lane, was opened. However, the expense of maintaining the grounds meant that the already florid Victorian monuments became spectacularly overgrown and the cemetery subsequently provided the ideal Gothic backdrop for films such as Hammer’sTaste The Blood Of DraculaandTales From The Crypt.\nCinematic luminaries in the eastern section includeWilliam Friese-Greene, interred close to the railings on the Swain’s Lane side, often credited as the inventor of cinema. The inscription on his tombstone, ‘The Inventor of Kinematography’, is certainly unequivocal, and even goes on to quote the patent number, for those who might doubt the claim.Friese-Greene, originally a portrait photographer, was certainly a prolific experimenter, but no businessman, and died in poverty in 1921. Thirty years later, during the patriotic frenzy of the Festival of Britain, he was played byRobert DonatinJohn Boulting’s dubious biopicThe Magic Box.\nOther notable cinematic figures in this section include German emigré screenwriterLukas Heller, who adapted the original source novels and plays into the screenplaysWhatever Happened to Baby Jane?,Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte,The Killing of Sister GeorgeandThe Dirty Dozenfor directorRobert Aldrich.Heller’s countrymanCarl Mayer, who wrote the screenplay for silent German expressionist classicDas Kabinett des Doktor Caligari(The Cabinet of Dr Caligari), also lies here.\nBritain’s ownMax Wall, the sepulchral-voiced, rubber-limbed music hall performer who reinvented himself as a respected straight actor, appearing inChitty Chitty Bang Bang,Terry Gilliam'sJabberwocky,Hanover Streetand, erm,The Nine Ages of Nakedness(well, we all have to earn a crust), is another occupant. Theatre knightsSir Ralph RichardsonandSir Michael Redgraveare also buried in Highgate.\nThe stern visage ofKarl Marx, possibly the most famous occupant of the cemetery, tops a bulky plinth in theEast Cemetery. Unreconstructed Stalinist Mrs Delt (Irene Handl) takes her son Morgan (David Warner) to pay homage at the grave ofMarxinKarel Reisz’s 1966 film ofDavid Mercer’s play,Morgan – A Suitable Case for Treatment. “You know, he wanted to shoot the royal family, abolish marriage and put everybody who’d been to public school in a chain gang,” says Handl. “Yes, he was a idealist, your dad.”\nYears later,Philip DavisandRuth Sheenalso pay their respects atMarx’s plot inMike Leigh’sHigh Hopes.\nIn the older, western section liesPatrick Wymark, the stocky character actor who appeared as the predatory Landlord inRoman Polanski’sRepulsionand as General Oliver Cromwell inMatthew Hopkins: Witchfinder General.\nThe cemetery is now owned and administered by the Friends of Highgate Cemetery. The East Cemetery is open to the public every day (except Christmas and Boxing Day) (admission charge).

That must be some good ice cream.\nHe’s out posting a letter to a six-year-old Tanzanian boy called Ndugu he’s impulsively ‘adopted’ in response to a Childreach television appeal (voiced byAngela Lansbury, if you were wondering).\nReturning home to find Helen lying dead on the floor, the new chapter turns out not to be the one he was expecting.\nThrifty as ever, Warren buys the second-cheapest coffin atJohn A Gentleman Mortuary, 1010 North 72nd Street, Omaha– a fact that doesn’t go unnoticed by his daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) at Helen’s funeral, which is held inBohemian Cemetery, 5201 Center Street.\nThere’s clearly friction between Warren and Jeannie, who’s flown in from Denver, Colorado, with husband-to-be Randall (Dermot Mulroney), but after Warren drops the couple off at the airport to return home, he has to start coming to terms with life alone. The airport, where his car infuriatingly stalls in the car park, isEppley Airfield, 4501 Abbott Drive.\nBlithely assuring Ndugu how well he’s coping in one of his therapeutic if inappropriately detailed letters, it’s obviously that his ordered life is starting to fray as Warren stocks up with mountains of frozen food atBaker’s Supermarket, 5222 South 136th Streetat Q Street and, in a deleted scene on DVD, also shoplifts Preparation H.\nThe final break with his old existence comes when Warren stumbles across a stash of old love letters to Helen from his best friend Ray (Len Cariou). He dumps his wife’s possessions by the recycle bins in the alley off50th Street, between Underwood Avenue and California Street, before confronting Ray outsideSouthwest Plaza Barber Shop, 4601 South 50th Street.\nNow freed from constraints, Warren takes to the road in the Adventurer to visit his daughter but, after a less than enthusiastic response to his phone call, he decides instead to undertake a sentimental journey through his old haunts.\nThere’s disappointment when he finds that his childhood home on ‘Locust Street, Holdrege’ has been replaced by a tyre store. This is a brief jaunt across the Missouri River from eastern Omaha intoIowa, toTires Plus, 2103 West BroadwayinCouncil Bluffs.\nIt’s straight back toNebraska, though, for Warren’s alma mater, the ‘University of Kansas’ in ‘Lawrence’. The campus is actually theUniversity of Nebraska, Lincoln(which had previously been seen in anotherJack Nicholsonfilm,Terms Of Endearment). His old ‘Beta Sigma Epsilon’ fraternity house is theDelta Delta Delta House, 1601 R Street, Lincoln.\nFrom here, Warren passes quickly thoughNebraska City, where the cinema, optimistically previewingPayne’s next film,Sideways, is thePioneer 3 Theatre, 110 South 11th Street, Nebraska City.\nWarren indulges in a little nostalgia for the Old West, first being awed by the fine collection of arrowheads atCuster County Historical Museum,445 South 9th Avenue, inBroken Bow, about 150 miles west of Omaha.\nIf you want to visit the museum, you’ll find it doesn’t look much like the old red-brick building  in the film, which uses the much more photographic exterior of theGrand Army of the Republic Memorial Hall, 910 1st Corso, back inNebraska City.\nHe next stops off to view‘Buffalo Bill’ Cody’s home,Buffalo Bill's Scout's Rest Ranch,2921 Scouts Rest Ranch Road, North Platte. You can visit it too, if you wish. The 25-acre ranch is a state historical park and the restored house contains memorabilia of the old showman.\nNew to the freewheeling life, Warren clumsily misreads the signals and makes unwanted moves on a neighbour’s wife in theLouisville SRA, 18510 Nebraska 50, Louisville, on the south bank of thePlatte River.\nThere’s a brief glimpse ofDenver, as the Winnebago is driven past theOgden Theatre, 935 East Colfax Avenueand south intoOgden Street, but the home of Randall’s controlling hippie mother Roberta (Kathy Bates) is3215 Poppleton Avenue, inSoutheast Omaha.\nAlso inColoradois the angular space age exterior of the church where the wedding rehearsal is held, which is theFirst Christian Church, 950 28th Street, Boulder, but the church interior isMessiah Lutheran Church, 5015 South 80th Street, at Lakeview Street,South Central Omaha.\nWarren is zonked out throughout the rehearsal on Roberta’s hysterectomy pills, and is still out of it throughout the speechifying at the pre-nuptial dinner inTony Roma's, 2510 South 132nd Street, West Omaha.\nThe wedding ceremony is a bit hand-made and unorthodox, but the reception where Warren gets to make his quietly passive-aggressive father-of-the-bride speech, held atDC Centre Banquet Facility, 7117 Jones Circle, Elmwood Park, is as excruciatingly traditional as you’d expect.\nReturning home, empty and defeated, Warren stops off at theGreat Platte River Road Archway,3060 East 1st Street, just south ofKearney, onI-80about 100 miles west of Lincoln. Unmissably spanning 310 feet across the interstate, the display presents 170 years of American history through film, computer graphics, life-size dioramas, re-enactors and more – and will take you around an hour to experience.\n", "locations": [{"name": "Omaha", "address": "Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska, United States", "latitude": 41.2587459, "longitude": -95.9383758, "descriptions": ["Change is triggered by retirement from his insurance job atWoodmen of the World Life Insurance Co, 1700 Farnam Street, inOmaha, where most of the movie is filmed.

But this isRichard Curtis’s universe, so he uses the gift to get a girlfriend.\nHollywood time travel was about confronting Morlocks and Eloi, or going back to learn from Soe-Crates that all we are is dust in the wind. This is England, so it’s used mainly to correct embarrassing socialfaux pas.\nThe Lake family inhabits a Grade II listed building (and a private home) on the coast ofCornwall, in the far southwest of England. It’sPorthpean House, Porthpean Beach Road, St Austell. It’s south of Charlestown – the picturesque harbour you can see inThe Eagle Has Landed, the 1993 version ofThe Three Musketeersand inTim Burton’s adaptation ofAlice In Wonderland.\nThe beach, supposedly below the house, isVault Beach,  eight miles down the coast, reached by a quite steep footpath south ofGorran Haven.\nTim, inevitably, leavesCornwallfor the excitement ofLondonwhere there’s the briefest glimpse ofPaddington Stationas he arrives and an even briefer one – for no obvious reason – of the famous pedestrian crossing onAbbey Road, featured onThe Beatles’Abbey Roadalbum cover.\nTim is staying with misanthropic playwright Harry (Tom Hollander) in northwestLondon, tucked away behind impenetrable hedge bushes at59 Brondesbury Road,Queen’s Park, NW6.\nHe trains as a lawyer in the sedate surroundings ofLincoln’s Inn Fields, nearHolborn, WC2. The home ofLondon’s legal profession, and seemingly untouched by time, it’s whereJohn Cleesehad his chambers inA Fish Called Wanda.\nTim and his pal enjoy an almost literal blind date with a couple of girls atDans Le Noir?, an eating experience which focuses the senses by serving food in total darkness.Dans Le Noir?, you may be surprised to hear, is a real restaurant (one of an international chain), which you’ll find at30-31 Clerkenwell Green(fans of British romcoms will rememberClerkenwellas the neighbourhood ofHugh GrantinAbout A Boy).\nHowever, that’s not what’s seen in the film.1 Newburgh StreetinSoho, W1, on the corner of a photogenically cobbled street, stands in.\nAfter having flirted with Mary (Rachel McAdams) in darkness, it’s here onNewburgh Streetthat Tim first claps eyes on her and immediately realises, in time-honoured Hollywood fashion, that she’s the one for him.\nHowever, the evening spent atDans Le Noir?means that Tim has missed Harry’s new play,A Guilty Man, which had its premiere on the same night. It’s hard to understand why Harry should be so grumpy when his lines are being spoken byRichard GriffithsandRichard E Grant(in unbilled cameos) at the venerableOld Vic Theatre,the Cut,  inWaterloo.\nTheOld Vic, which used to house the National Theatre underLaurence Olivier, before the company’s purpose-built South Bank home was built, was run very successfully for several years byKevin Spacey– before his fall from grace.\nAfter travelling back to catch Harry’s play, Tim learns that messing with time brings its own problems as his encounter with Mary has been erased (though somehow he still remembers it). This in turn obliges him to rescue their potential relationship by engineering another meeting.\nTo stave off Mary’s liaison with another boy, Tim crashes a party at26 Courtfield Gardensat Barkston Gardens, in a classy square nearEarl’s Court, SW5, and quickly whisks her away for a meal.\nThe neighbourhood is hardly short of restaurants of all types and budgets, so it’s a bit odd that they end up inBayswater, atZorba’s Greek Taverna, 36 Leinster Gardens, W2.\nAnd even odder that he then walks her home to her flat, which turns out to be102 Golborne Road, W10, at the top end ofPortobello Roadmarket. This was the backdrop, of course, to theCurtis-scriptedNotting Hilland Mary’s flat is directly oppositePortfolio, the shop used as the failed restaurant ofHugh Grant’s friend in that film.\nThe area seems to suit Tim, as he’s soon moving in with Mary, thoughLondon’s geography gets even wonkier when it appears that the couple’s local tube station, which features quite heavily, isMaida Vale, about a mile away. At least they’re getting plenty of exercise. It has to be admitted, though, thatMaida Valeis a pretty photogenic station – see its virtually unmodernised interior inNeil Jordan’s 1999 adaptation ofGraham Greene’sThe End Of The Affairand its exterior as the fictitious ‘Westbourne Oak Station’ in the surprisingly enjoyable 2014 film ofPaddington.\nThere’s a brief diversion as Tim attends a play at theNational Theatreand bumps into his first crush, Charlotte, outside the monumentalSouth Bankcomplex (pretty near whereHugh Grant– yes, again – bumblingly admitted “I think I love you” inFour Weddings And A Funeral).\nBefore anything untoward happens, Tim comes to his senses and rushes home to propose to Mary.\nIt’s back toCornwallfor the wedding, which is held inSt Michael Penkivel Church, in a small village three miles southeast ofTruro.

Not to mention the Plaster of Paris trees and rocks imported by art directorCarl Jules Weyl, the telephone poles festooned with foliage, and the real grass replaced with artificial turf to cut down the fire risk.\nChico, 30 miles east of I-5 and halfway between Sacramento and Redding, NorthernCalifornia, is actually built around the ten-mile-long park, which was donated by the widow of city founder William Bidwell. Here is the spot where Hood’s men stage the raid on the treasure caravan of Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone).\nIt’s atBig Chico Creek, running throughChico Canyonin the park, Hood challenges Little John to a longstaff fight and later, in the creek, duels with Friar Tuck.\n‘Robin Hood’s camp’ itself – site of the huge banquet following the treasure raid, when Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland) begins to thaw out – was about a mile from the park entrance, around Hooker – called ‘Gallows Oak’ in the film – the world’s largest oak tree. 92 feet tall, 149 feet across its branches and named after, not a Santa Monica Boulevard nightworker, but British naturalistSir Joseph Hooker.\nBidwell Parkwas also used for some exterior shots inGone With The Wind.\nChicois on the Seattle-Sacramento railway line, and also on the north-south Greyhound route.\nThe archery tournament, where a too-cocky Hood gets arrested, was filmed in the old Busch Gardens,Pasadena. Don’t bother to look for them. The gardens, another popular film location, seen also inCitizen Kane, have long since gone the way of many great landmarks ofLos Angeles. Additional shots for this scene were filmed at theMidwick Country Club.\nExtra shots for the attack on the treasure caravan were filmed in theSherwood LakeandSherwood Forestarea. No, not on a location trip to the UK. ThisSherwood Forestcan be found about fifteen miles west ofLos Angeles, south of Westlake Village on Potrero Road just off Highway 101 near the Santa Monica Mountains. The name is no coincidence, it comes from the use as a location in the 1922Douglas Fairbanksfilm ofRobin Hood, but it also stood in for the 'African' jungle forTarzan And His Matein 1934.\nThe lower part of ‘Nottingham Castle’ (its upper reaches are a matte painting) was built on the old Warners’ Calabasas Ranch. This too has gone. The area is now a golf course and housing development south of Ventura Freeway on the road toward Westlake.\nThe streets of ‘Nottingham’ are the ‘Dijon Street’ on the Warners’ Burbank backlot, and the interiors filmed here too. If you take theWarner Bros VIP Studio Tour(and I recommend it), you might be lucky enough to see chandeliers from the production (along with other treasures such as the lamps from ‘Rick’s Bar’ inCasablanca).\nThis tour, unlike the Universal Studios theme park, is the real thing – a small-scale guided tour around the surprisingly unchanged and low-tech lot whereJack Warnerkept his stars on a short leash and his movies on a tight budget.

{"url": "https://movie-locations.com/movies/a/Aeon-Flux.php", "title": "Aeon Flux | 2005", "image": "https://movie-locations.com/movies/a/Aeon-Flux.jpg", "text_content": "Peter Chung, creator of the originalMTVanimated series, distanced himself from the big-screen transfer, though it’s hard to see how his near-silent, semi-abstract vignettes could have been turned into a feature film without dialogue and a solid backstory.\nIn the year 2415, after a disease has wiped out most of the human race, the Earth’s last city, Bregna, is protected by wall from the outside world and ruled over by Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), a descendant of the person who brought the mysterious infection under some sort of control. Life in the city, though, is something of a gilded cage, challenged by an underground resistance group called Monicans.\nFirst choice to represent the city of ‘Bregna’ was Brasilia, the capital ofBrazil, but ultimately the selection ofBerlin’s ultra-design-conscious architecture is perfect – a startling array of chapels, a crematorium, a prestigious art museum, a foreign embassy and even a 21st Century state-of-the-art animal shelter.\nThe opening montage of the supposedly ‘perfect society’ gives a glimpse of many of the locations seen throughout the film.\nThe production was based at the  theBabelsberg StudiosatPotsdam, southwest ofBerlin.  Built in 1917 as theUFA(Universum Film Aktien Gesellschaft)Studios, the studio really is whereJoseph Goebbelsshot his notorious propaganda films for the Führer. Yet before being co-opted for such noxious vehicles as the infamousJud Süss,Babelsbergwas home to such classics of the Twenties and Thirties asNosferatu,The Cabinet of Dr Caligari,MetropolisandThe Blue Angel. The studio has had something of a resurgence in recent years withInglourious Basterds,The Grand Budapest HotelandV For Vendettaamong the films shot here.\nNot surprisingly, several of the film’s locations are near toPotsdam. The formal terrace garden bisected by a staircase can be found atSans Souci,Potsdam’s complex of elegant palaces and parks. It’s here that Monican agent Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) receives, in a kiss, the pill that enables her to communicate psychically with The Handler (Frances McDormand).\nFrom central Berlin, you can get a train toPotsdamand from the station, it’s a short bus ride toSans Souciitself. You can see the palaces inStanley Kubrick’sBarry Lyndonand in the ill-fated 2004 remake ofAround The World In 80 Days.\nBack in centralBerlin, the inclined white pillars which form the striking façade of the marketplace, where Bregnians seem to be disappearing, is the entrance to theEmbassy of Mexico(Mexikanische Botschaft),Klingelhöferstraße 3, directly south of Tiergarten.\nPerhaps the most unusual practical location provides the overview of the city and the site of the final battle. This isTierheim(animal shelter),Hausvaterweg 39, Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, northeast of the city.\nThe ultra-modern facility, one of the largest animal shelters in Europe, supplies ‘Bregna’s’ central core of circular buildings and water gardens. Opened in 2002 with cat houses, dog houses, a small animal house, a clinic and even an animal cemetery,Tierheimhas since been expanded to accommodate rescued farm animals.\nThe pill swallowed by Aeon puts her into a trance state where she’s able to communicate with the Handler in what looks like a ghostly lecture chamber. And that’s just what it is. Continuing the animal care theme, this isLanghansbau Anatomisches Theater(Anatomical Theater of the University of Veterinary Medicine),Philippstraße 12/13, east of Luisenstraße in the historic quarter ofFriedrich-Wilhelm-Stadt. The oldest surviving academic teaching building in the city, it’s now used as an exhibition and events space by theHermann von Helmholtz Center for Cultural Technology. You probably recognised it again inThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\nThe mission given to Aeon is to sabotage the Goodwill surveillance facility, which monitors Monican activity.\nThe spy centre with its swoopingly curvaceous elliptical roof turns out to beHaus der Kulturen der Welt(House of the World's Cultures),John-Foster-Dulles-Allee 10,Germany's national centre for the “presentation and discussion of international contemporary arts” – a space for art exhibitions, theater and dance performances, concerts, films and conferences in theTiergarten. Like many of the city’s landmarks, it has its own slyly descriptive nickname, in this case the Pregnant Oyster.\nThe unique history ofBerlinweights many of its sites with a baleful significance which it’s hard to ignore. So it proves with ‘Bregna’s’ giant mural of Goodchild and the entrance to the city's subway system. This is the wide, blank frontage ofKirche Maria Regina Martyrum, (Commemorative Church of Mary Queen of Martyrs),Heckerdamm 230inCharlottenburg-Nord.\nThis church honours the martyrs for freedom of religion and conscience during the years of Nazi rule and is a short walk from walk from Plötzensee Prison (now the memorial Gedenkstätte Plötzensee), where so many who resistedHitlerwere executed – including those involved inClaus von Stauffenberg’s 1944 plot against the life of the führer.\nThe circular corridor surrounding the bustling marketplace, in which a man is desperately searching for his missing daughter and where Aeon meets her sister Una (Amelia Warner) to explain she can’t come to her party, isKapelle der Versoehnung(Chapel of Reconciliation),Bernauer Straße 4.\nThe chapel stands on the site of the old Church of Reconciliation which, following the division ofBerlinin 1945, found itself marooned in the Soviet sector, though most of its congregation came from the neighbouring French sector. As a further indignity, the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 left it inaccessible to everyone except border guards, who used its tower as an observation post.\nIn 1985, the church was finally demolished on the orders of the GDR (German Democratic Republic) government. The new chapel stands alongside the old foundations, which you can still see.\nUna’s housing complex, where she’s mistaken for a member of the Monican resistance and killed, is theBauhaus-Archiv,Klingelhöferstraße 14, which you’ll find a little to the south of the Mexican Embassy.\nTheBauhaus Archive Museum of Designdisplays art pieces, documents and literature relating to the Bauhaus School, the influential minimalist functional design movement founded byWalter Gropiusin 1919.\nAeon is now instructed to terminate Goodchild himself, and she insists on her companion Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo), who’s usefully had her feet replaced by a second set of hands, accompanying her to cross the frontier garden to reach the government zone.\nThe oddly-crenellated section of wall where Sithandra meets up with Aeon is theSkateparkin theVolkspark Potsdam, northeast of the Sans Souci park inPotsdam. Created to host the 2001 Federal Horticultural Show, the park itself provides the deadly frontier garden with its booby traps and lethally spiky grass.\nAnother extraordinary location is the citadel chamber in which Goodchild witnesses the friction between his brother Oren (Jonny Lee Miller) and Giroux (Paterson Joseph). This is a crematorium – theKrematorium Baumschulenweg,Kiefholzstraße 221– more superlatives – the most modern cremation plant in Europe when it was opened in 1999. It's another location also featured  inThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\nThe film’s signature oval corridors, terminated by vertical slats, in which Aeon and Sithandra find themselves, areWindkanal, the Great Wind Tunnel of theAerodynamic ParkinBerlin-Adlershof, built in 1934. The tunnel, protected as part of the former location of the German Aerospace Center, was used to investigate air currents but it’s now not very stable and rarely opened to the public.\nThe wind tunnel was also used inJoe Wright's 2011Hanna, withSaoirse Ronan.\nWith the assistance of a guard’s headset, Aeon gets directions to the auditorium in which Goodchild is rehearsing his address to the council. The 1920s art decoRenaissance-Theater,Knesebeckstraße 100at Hardenbergstraße in the Charlottenburg district, offers a break from all the bleak modernism. It was built to house a student association in 1902, becoming a silent cinema in 1919.\nIn October 1922 it reopened as theRenaissance-Theaterand is claimed to be the only completely preserved original art deco theatre in Europe.\nAeon hesitates in her mission to kill Goodchild when he appears to recognise her, and calls her Catherine.\nArrested, Aeon soon escapes with the aid of a flock of little metal balls to confront Claudius (Nikolai Kinski), another Monican, about his collaboration with the Goodchild regime.\nBotanist Claudius is beavering away among his plants to discover why the people of Bregna are experiencing strange dreams and memories of events that never happened.\nHis greenhouse isBiosphäre Potsdam,Georg-Hermann-Allee 99, an indoor tropical botanical garden, back in in theVolkspark Potsdam.\nThe garden contains around 20,000 tropical plants, including orchids, epiphytes, and trees, including a palm grove and mangrove swamp, along with a waterfall, two lakes, and tropical wildlife, including iguanas, snakes, spiders, frogs, geckos, and pheasants, as well as a butterfly house. It is open daily (admission fee).\nAeon begins to realise that things are not as simple as they appeared – and perhaps Trevor Goodchild isn’t the villain she’s been led to believe.\nSpoilers: It transpires that the cure to the industrial disease had the side-effect of rendering the population infertile and the human race is being kept viable by cloning.\nTrevor and his brother Oren meet their clones in theClay Headquarters Compound, the former American headquarters onClayalleeat Saargemünder Strasse in theZehlendorfdistrict.\nOriginally constructed by the Luftwaffe before WWII, the building was commandeered by the US Army Berlin as HQ forGeneral Lucius D Clayduring the Berlin Airlift (the emergency operation to deliver supplies to West Berlin after it was blockaded by the Soviet Union in 1948).\nThe compound has been sold to a private developer with plans to convert it into (surprise!) commercial office space and high-end condominium residences.\nWhen the ambitious Oren declares his brother a traitor, Aeon and Trevor team up, escaping into Bregna’s subway system.\nThe entrance to the subway isKirche Maria Regina MartyruminCharlottenburg-Nord. again, but the station platform is the interior of theVelodrom,Paul-Heyse-Straße 26, in the Prenzlauer Berg district.\nMore than just a cycling arena, theVelodrom, built for the unsuccessful bid for the 2000 Olympics, now hosts all kinds of indoor sporting events as well as trade shows and concerts.\nAeon and Trevor suddenly pop up from the subway on theSpandauer Lake Bridge, crossing theRiver Havel, just north of Spandau (famous of course for the prison in whichRudolf Hesswas long held).\nWhen Trevor needs to recover his notes for the cure, the pair sneak into the guardroom tower, where guards are talked into cooperating. This cylindrical tower is theTrudelturm, another part ofBerlin’s Aerodynamic Park (which earlier supplied the tunnels).\nOnce below ground this time, the team are making their way through the arched brick tunnels of the disused GothicFiltergewoelbe Wasserwerk Friedrichshagen(Friedrichshagen Waterworks).\nOnce again, superlatives – when completed in 1893, this was the largest and the most modern of its kind in Europe, planned by UK engineerHenry Gill.

For a while, this housedPrague’s Museum of Musical Instruments but it’s now home to theAnglo-American College, a private liberal arts college and not open to the public.\nA little to the northeast of the Knights' Palace, the injured Salieri is rushed through the streets of old 'Vienna', represented byMisenska, a narrow, curved cobbled street running west fromU Lužického semináře.\nThe hospital in which he's incarcerated and where he confesses all to the flummoxed young priest, isZa Invalidovnou 579/3, in theKarlindistrict to the northeast of the Old Town.\nThe complex was built in 1737 based on the idea of Les Invalides inParis, to house invalided war veterans and gives its name to the local metro station,Invalidovna.\nIn 1935, the patients were moved to another facility and the building taken over for use by the Czech army, but after being damaged by the disastrous flood of 2002 it was closed and shuttered, until extensive renovations can be carried out.\nThe story flashes back to Salieri's first encounter with Mozart (Tom Hulce), when he sets himself the goal of recognising the the young prodigy at a concert given by the Prince Archbishop Colloredo of Salzburg. The lavish interior of the Prince's palace is the BaroqueKromeriz Castle, northern Moravia in the eastern part of theCzech Republic, the one-time residence of bishops and archbishops of Olomouc in Moravia.\nThe castle’s Audience Chamber was also used in another classical biopic, 1994'sImmortal Beloved, withGary Oldmanas Beethoven. The palace and its gardens are open for guided tours.\nThe palace of Vienna's Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) is the restoredArchbishop’s Palace(Arcibiskupsky Palác, formerly Gryspek Palace) onHradcanské námestí(Hradcany Square), the residence of Prague's archbishops since 1562.\nOriginally a Renaissance mansion, it was bought byFerdinand Ifrom the Royal Private Secretary –Florian von Gryspek– and presented to the Catholic Archbishop of Prague. During the 16th century it was rebuilt and extended before being remodelled in the Baroque style between 1675 and 1688. In 1764Johan Joseph Wirchreworked it into Rococo style and decorated the interior in sumptuous splendour. It's the HQ of the Catholic Church in Prague and not open to the public.\nThe excitable Mozart gets a little too enthusiastic when trying on a selection of extravagant wigs.

You can’t say they skimped on detail – keep your eyes peeled for the discarded gum and fake pigeons added for Big Apple authenticity.\nThe apartment of Capt Stacy and daughter Gwen (Emma Stone) needs no such dressing.

Oscorp’s vast three-story lobby is a set built inBrooklyn’sMarcy Armory, 355 Marcy Avenueat Lynch Street, dressed with authentic – and costly – artwork loaned by some ofNew York's most prestigious galleries. The armory has previously housed sets for productions such asWill Smithsci-fiI Am LegendandGuy Ritchie’sSherlock Holmes.\nThe attempt by Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) to hijack an Oscorp truck carrying plutonium seems to cause chaos throughout centralManhattanbut since there is apparently a NYC regulation banning cars from exceeding 30mph during filming (news to me), many of the big stunts were filmed  about 300 miles to the northwest, onMain StreetinRochester, toward Lake Ontario in UpstateNew York.\nTheRochesterchase doesn’t make a lot of sense geographically (since you’re not supposed to recognise the background) – so Sytsevich is first barrelling east onEast Main Streettoward theGenesee River Bridge, then roaring west under the pedestrian overpass on the other side of the river (you can see quite a lot of the overpass in the background throughout the sequence).\nSpiderman is meanwhile swinging along6th Avenue / Avenue of the Americasat 48th Street, with a cheery cry of “Hello pedestrians!”, and nerdy Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) carries his load of blueprints along8th Avenue, scattering them on the sidewalk at56th Street. This just happens to be alongside the Oscorp building, which is where the two have their first fateful meeting as Spidey rescues Max from being crushed by a flying yellow cab.\nThe cop car bottleneck and shoot-em-up is back onMain Street, Rochester, but the diversion through a narrow alleyway brings the Oscorp truck back toManhattan, out ontoMadison StreetinChinatown, between Catherine Street and Market Street, below the Manhattan Bridge Overpass, where Spidey scoops up the stray container of plutonium and gets “caught up in traffic”.\nThe truck has suddenly crossed theEast River, to appear below the Brooklyn end of theManhattan Bridge, where it smashes into a bus on the cobbles and disused tracks ofPlymouth Street.\nAlongside the monumental arches of the Bridge onAnchorage Place, Spidey subdues – and depantses – Sytsevich, before heading off to make it in time for graduation.\nFortunately the ‘Midtown Science High School’ ceremony is being held barley half a mile away at theEast River Park Amphitheater, on theLower East Side. The park lies on the east side ofFDR Drive, between Montgomery Street and 12th Street. The amphitheater, regularly used for public performances, is on theEast River PromenadeatCorlears Hook, south of the Williamsburg Bridge.\nPeter agrees to meet Gwen (Emma Stone) later that evening but, when the time comes, he hesitates outsideNom Wah Tea Parlor,13 Doyers StreetinChinatown. This famous dim sum house, which opened originally next door at 11) in 1920, has previously been seen inWoody Allen'sRadio Days,Reversal of FortuneandKing Of New York.\nRemembering the promise he made to her father not to put Gwen in danger, it’s outside the restaurant onDoyers Streetthings come to a head and they reluctantly break up.\nA world away, on the swankyUpper East Side, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), visits his illness ravaged father Norman (Chris Cooper) in the lavish Italianate palazzo at1 East 91st StreetonFifth Avenue, overlooking Central Park. One ofNew York's largest private houses, the last on the so-called Millionaire's Row, the mansion was built in 1918 for bankerOtto Kahnand later became the Convent of the Sacred Heart. Fittingly, it was used as the Bishop’s ‘Boston’ palace inSidney Lumet’sThe Verdict, withPaul Newman, and as the apartment block robbed in the same director’sThe Anderson Tapes. It also supplied the interior of 2 East 91st Street, which stands opposite, inWorking Girl.\nMeeting for the first time since childhood, Peter and Harry catch up, and skim stones, on theBrooklynwaterfront, in the peaceful surrounds of theEmpire-Fulton Ferry State Park,26 New Dock Street, the nine-acre green space between Manhattan Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge. You can see the park again in 2004 fantasy rom-com13 Going On 30.\nAt night, Peter and Gwen meet up at the market inUnion Square Park, Union Squarebetween East 14th and 16th Streets, where they reconcile to become just friends. All is looking good until, on theHigh Line, Gwen drops the bombshell that she’s of to England to study at Oxford University.\nHigh Line Parkis a mile-long linear, aerial greenway constructed by planting the old elevated West Side Line, a disused spur of the New York Central Railroad, with greenery. The imaginative repurposing  was inspired by a similar project in Paris, which you might have seen inRichard Linklater’sBefore Sunset.\nMeanwhile Max, having been ripped off by his employer, Oscorp, and had his Selina Kyle-moment falling into a tank of electric eels, discovers he’s been reborn as Electro – a glowing blue entity feeding on electricity (though more modestly attired than Dr Manhattan inWatchmen).\nTempted by the power surging through the bright lights ofTimes Square, he finds himself cornered by cops, and when Spider-Man’s well-meaning intervention is botched, Electro goes into full-on Carrie mode.\nAlthough some of the filming took place at the realTimes Square, the spectacular scene necessitated the construction of a huge reproduction ofNew York’s dazzling heart on the backlot ofGold Coast StudiosinBethpage, Oyster Bay on Long Island.\nEventually captured, Electro is taken off to ‘Ravencroft Institute for the Criminally Insane’, which seems to be Oscorp’s reply to ‘Arkham Asylum’. The solid, five-sided fortress is the oldFort Schuyler,6 Pennyfield Avenue,Throggs Neck, now theMaritime Museum– part ofSUNY Maritime College Communitybeneath the Throggs Neck Bridge in theBronx.\nAway from Gwen, and dwelling on the mystery of his parents, Peter follows the clue of subway tokens to a reconstruction of the old Roosevelt Spur, an underground station built for as a private VIP entrance beneath the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. According to legend, this was used byFDRto keep the president’s disability from public view. It’s here that Peter discovers his father’s old lab.\nBut when he exits the tunnel on foot, it’s from the southern entrance to theEast New York Tunnel, at the abandonedEast New York Stationon the disused Bay Ridge LIRR line. The remains of the station, just beneathAtlantic Avenueat Van Sinderen Avenue alongside Atlantic Avenue  station inBrooklyn, can be seen from Liberty Avenue, alongside the elevated L Line.\nThe Oscorp power plant where the final confrontation plays out is another giant set atGold Coast Studios.\nLike the previous film, the story seems set to end with a funeral, this time held atLutheran Cemetery, onMetropolitan AvenueinMiddle Village,Queens.\nBut a final twist sees Sytsevich getting his hands on a giant metal suit, appearing as the Rhino, threatening mayhem onPark AvenuebetweenEast 52nd and East 53rd Streets, and prompting Spider-Man’s much-needed return to crime fighting.\n", "locations": [{"name": "Spider-Man", "address": "Spider Man, Podgórna, Rybaki, Stare Miasto, Poznań, województwo wielkopolskie, 61-831, Polska", "latitude": 52.4056009, "longitude": 16.9317793, "descriptions": ["Like all theSpider-Manfilms, including theRaimitrilogy,Amazing Spider-Man 2is set inNew York, but surprisingly this is the first one to be wholly filmed there (the others all feature scenes shot inLos Angelesand other cities)."]}, {"name": "36 Fuller Place", "address": "36, Fuller Place, Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, Kings County, City of New York, New York, 11215, United States", "latitude": 40.6583769, "longitude": -73.9801936, "descriptions": ["A couple of familiar places return from the first movie, including the Parker home, which is36 Fuller Place, just to the north of Prospect Avenue, in theWindsor Terraceneighbourhood ofBrooklyn."]}, {"name": "Windsor Terrace", "address": "Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, Kings County, City of New York, New York, United States", "latitude": 40.653487, "longitude": -73.977196, "descriptions": ["A couple of familiar places return from the first movie, including the Parker home, which is36 Fuller Place, just to the north of Prospect Avenue, in theWindsor Terraceneighbourhood ofBrooklyn."]}, {"name": "Brooklyn", "address": "Brooklyn, Kings County, City of New York, New York, United States", "latitude": 40.6526006, "longitude": -73.9497211, "descriptions": ["A couple of familiar places return from the first movie, including the Parker home, which is36 Fuller Place, just to the north of Prospect Avenue, in theWindsor Terraceneighbourhood ofBrooklyn.", "That’s not the Hearst’s real interior.

{"url": "https://movie-locations.com/movies/a/American-Gangster.php", "title": "American Gangster | 2007", "image": "https://movie-locations.com/movies/a/American-Gangster.jpg", "text_content": "Somewhat glamourised epic on the rise, fall and redemption of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), entrepreneur drug dealer who flooded Harlem with reasonably-priced heroin in the late Sixties, until he was brought to justice by dogged Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe).\nIt’s claimed that the film used 180 different locations, in all the five boroughs ofNew York City, with a few days' filming in upstateNew Yorkand suburbanLong Island.\nIt’s also made on practical locations, though some interiors (including Lucas' heroin-cutting den and the housing projects in which the final drug busts take place) were filmed onGovernors Island, a few miles across New York Harbor from the Statue of Liberty. A former army barracks and training base, the high-rise buildings that once housed military personnel have been vacant for years and housed several interior sets.\nThe film opens in ‘Harlem, 1968’ as Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III) bemoans the lack of the personal touch in business as he balefully surveys the goods on display in an electronics store. His time is over, he’s taken ill and dies.\nThe store is inHarlem, but it’s not an electronics store, nor even the sneakers store it’s become by the end of the film. It’s theTuck-it-Away Self-Storagefacility,3330 Broadway‪, on the southwest corner of135th Street.\nRichie Roberts is supposedly based out of New Jersey – hence much of the animosity with theNew Yorkcops – but, more often than not,New Yorkstands in – which made much of the film confusing for local New Yorkers.\nFollowing a tip-off, Richie and his partner Javier (John Ortiz) head off to pick out a bookie. The subtitle reads ‘New Jersey’, but that’s theWilliamsburg Bridgelooming over the background and they’re actually driving alongSouth 3rd StreetatKent Streetnear the East River waterfront inBrooklyn.\nThey eject their informant from the car on6th Streetand it’s in the empty lot atBroadway and Bedford Avenuethey discover $987,000 in drug money in the trunk of a car. Despite Javier’s protests, straight-arrow Richie turns the haul in and the pair find themselves pariahs within the then-notoriously corrupt force.\nIn the wake of confusion following Bumpy’s death, Frank is meeting with Mafia man Rossi (Jon Polito) who bemoans the current anarchic state of business – the police adulterate the drugs they seize and sell them back to the dealers.\nThe bar is art deco Thirties gem the Lenox Lounge, which stood at288 Lenox Avenue, between 124th and 125th Streets inHarlem.\nOpened in 1939, the bar witnessed performances by many greats of jazz, includingBillie Holiday,Miles DavisandJohn Coltrane, and attracted the likes ofMalcolm Xand Harlem Renaissance writers such asJames BaldwinandLangston Hughesas patrons.\nIts fortunes waned over the years but, despite a major renovation in the 1990s, the lounge closed at the end of 2012 and the building was gutted. Conflicting reports speculated that a new venue would open on the site or that the Lenox itself would reopen at 333 Lenox Avenue. Unbelievably, the Lenox Lounge was demolished in 2017.\nIf you look across the road as Frank calls his ‘cousin’ in Bangkok from a booth outside the Lenox, you can see that one company is showing amazing foresight by advertising its website in the late 60s.\nThe old Lenox was also seen inSpike Lee’s epic biopicMalcolm X, withDenzel Washingtonagain, and inJohn Singleton’s 2000 update ofShaft, withSamuel L Jackson.\n‘Lucille’s’, the café which becomes the unofficial headquarters for Frank and his guys, and where he’s challenged the top position by Tango (Idris Elba), was an invention, though. It was added for the movie to the exterior of the imposing brownstone on the corner ofLenox Avenue and 122nd Street. Next door became the exterior of Frank’s drug operation, while it’s a few doors along122nd Streetin the other direction past Lenox Avenue, that Frank eventually removes Tango from the scene for good.\nFrank playing on the beach with his dog and the flashback to a meeting with Bumpy at the hotdog stall is filmed in front ofAstrolandon theConey Island Boardwalk. In the background you can see the famousParachute Jump, frequently glimpsed in the Coney Island-setRequiem For A Dream.\nWith the cops peddling low-grade product, Frank plans to cut out the middleman and deal directly with the heroin producers in the Far East and their pure product.\nIngeniously, the gangster moved shipments on military planes to Eastern Seaboard bases in a scheme which saw up to eight kilos of pure grade heroin concealed in the false bottoms of coffins of dead servicemen.Ridley Scottre-created Lucas' time in Southeast Asia in NorthernThailand.\nTo represent the opium-processing centre, a traditional Thai village and rice barn were constructed in the middle of a peanut field about two hours north of the city ofChiang Mai.      The market scenes were filmed in the city ofChiang Maiitself.\nBack inNew York, Richie gets a frantic call from his partner Javier who’s trapped in an apartments block by an angry mob after a drug-addled cop has shot his dealer. The apartment block is theMarlboro ProjectsonWest 11th StreetatAvenue Vin theGravesendsection of southBrooklyn, 28 buildings that offering low-cost housing to 1,700 families and also home to numerous drug dealers, petty thieves and gangs.\nWhen Richie refuses to cover up for him, Javier leaps from the back of the moving ambulance in which they’re escaping onThird AvenueatBrook Avenue, opposite the Old Bronx Courthouse in theBronx.\nOnce Frank’s pure ‘Blue Magic’ product floods the city, there are inevitable ODs, including that of Javier himself. The morgue where Richie dolefully surveys the body of his partner was filmed inNational Guard Armories, 430 Western Avenue, Morristown,New Jersey.\nWith no-one now willing to work alongside him, Richie is visited by his superior Toback (Ted Levine) to offer him the chance to set up a Special Narcotics Bureau team of hand-picked officers – rather likeThe Untouchables.\nTheir new HQ, an abandoned old church, isSt Martin’s, 230 Lenox Avenueat122nd Street, which in reality is directly across from Frank’s ‘Lucille’s’ HQ. It’s claimed that this 19th century church is one of the best example of the Romanesque Revival architectural style in Manhattan. Though severely damaged in two fires, it’s been lovingly restored with the stylish stained- and leaded-glass windows and doors you can see in the film.\nWith business booming, Frank calls his brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor) at the family farm in ‘North Carolina’ and invites the family to visit.\nThey arrive to discover he’s bought a swanky new home for his mother. The white-pillared mansion isBriarcliff Manor, 508 Scarborough Road, New York.\nThe Greek Revival home was built in 1820 and completely remodelled in the 1920s, and is valued at around $4,750,000. The family’s journey wasn’t as long as it seems. The Lucas farm was also filmed on theBriarcliffestate.\nRichie’s team dumps everything they know so far and starts again, working up from the streets, with a night-time stake-out under the ‘el’ atBroadway and Myrtle Avenue. There’s activity at an unmarked doorway at952 Broadwayand the team is off following a bagman who emerges from the door.\nHe leads them to the office of the ‘Brushless Car Wash’ which is immediately put under surveillance.\nThe carwash, where undercover Richie hands over a bagful of cash for a consignment of Blue Magic, has since been demolished. It stood at125th Street at 12th Avenuebeneath the huge arches of theRiverside Drive ViaductinManhattanville. Incidentally, it’s opposite the famous Cotton Club.\nFollowing the money, the team find themselves crossing from ‘New Jersey’ into Manhattan, to176th Street Station, where the bagman takes it into a café, which is now CFSC check cashing, on the corner of1792 Jerome Avenueat East 176th Street inMorris Heights / West Bronx.\nThe NYC cops, under Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) come in for their shakedown and it’s around the corner on Townsend Avenue that Richie Roberts confronts them to get his money back – and gets a warning not to come in to NYC again, without permission.\nWith the drug distribution status quo threatened, Frank visits the huge estate of Italian mobster Dominic Cattano (Armand Assante) for talks, which opens up national distribution to him moves him further up the food chain.\nThe estate isOld Westbury Gardens,Long Island, most famously seen inAlfred Hitchcock'sNorth By Northwest, as well as 1971 weepieLove Story,Cruel IntentionsandWolf. The Gardens themselves are 160 acres, surrounding a mansion built in 1906 for steel-business magnateJohn Phipps.\nBut Frank’s fall is about to begin after he ignores his own advice and, to please his girlfriend Eva (Lymari Nadal), he turns up in a preposterously ostentatious chinchilla coat – and hat – to take his expensive seat at theMuhammad Ali-Joe Frasierfight in Madison Square Garden.\nIn fact, the big fight scene was filmed in theNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, UniondaleonLong Island, where the arena was filled with extras in period costumes, along with many celebrity lookalikes – and several hundred dummies packing out the 16,000 seat venue. For the first time, he appears on Richie’s radar. The venue has been substantially redeveloped since filming.\nFrank marries Eva atMount Olivet Baptist Church, 201 Malcolm X Boulevard(Lenox Avenue and West 120th Street) inHarlem. Built in 1907 as a synagogue called Temple Israel of Harlem, the building has been occupied by Mount Olivet Baptist Church since the mid 1920s.\nThe couple move into an upscale apartment at50 Sutton Place Southbetween East 54th and East 55th Streets, on the swanky section ofNew York'sEast Sidebeneath theQueensboro Bridge. You may remember the next-door block, 36 Sutton Place South, as home toMarilyn Monroe,Lauren BacallandBetty Grablein 1953’sHow To Marry A Millionaire.\nApart from the cops, Frank is also having problems with his flamboyant business partner Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding Jr) and making plenty of enemies, which culminates in an attempt on his life. The Christmas drive-by shooting is outside what was China City Restaurant, nowXing Wang Restaurant, 914 Broadwayat Stockton Street, just a few doors northwest of the stakeout site inBrooklyn.\nIncidentally, this is only a couple of doors away from the bar busted by 'Popeye' Doyle (Gene Hackman) inThe French Connection.\nWhen Frank’s cousin is compromised and obliged to wear a wire, Frank’s career is over. The team supposedly raids the ‘Steven Crane Projects’ of ‘Newark, NJ’, but you can clearly see theStillwell Avenue‘el’ alongside which they assemble. It’s back to theMarlboro Projects(where Richie’s partner had earlier got into trouble), which they enter the estate fromAvenue V, just east of Stillwell, where the bloody shoot-out culminates with the arrest of Frank’s brother Huey.\nFrank himself is arrested as he emerges from a service atMount Olivet Baptist Church, 201 Malcolm X Boulevard, where he was married earlier.\nHis trial is held inBrooklyn Supreme Court Civil Term Building, 360 Adams Street, Brooklyn, which you might remember as where Carrie eventually married Mr Big inSex And The City.\nThe film ends where it began with the newly-released Frank learning from Richie what a ‘latte’ is, discovering that the ‘electronics’ store is selling $100 sneakers and ‘8th Avenue’ is now ‘Frederick Douglass Boulevard’.\nOnce again, it’s by the rails at the junction ofBroadway and 135th Street.\n", "locations": [{"name": "Long Island", "address": "Long Island, New York, United States", "latitude": 40.8514971, "longitude": -73.0994297, "descriptions": ["It’s claimed that the film used 180 different locations, in all the five boroughs ofNew York City, with a few days' filming in upstateNew Yorkand suburbanLong Island.", "The estate isOld Westbury Gardens,Long Island, most famously seen inAlfred Hitchcock'sNorth By Northwest, as well as 1971 weepieLove Story,Cruel IntentionsandWolf.

Complaints of racial insensitivity soon had the FBI claiming the name was short for ‘Abdul scam’, after their invented sheikh.\nThe film is set largely in ‘New York’ and ‘New Jersey’ but, apart from a little scene setting, was made inMassachusetts, much of it around the city ofWorcester, about 40 miles west of Boston, where the flashback to Rosenfeld’s youth in ‘Brooklyn’ – giving the family’s glazing business a bit of a boost by smashing windows – was filmed onMillbury Street, just south of downtown.\n20 miles to the east, betweenNatickandFramingham, you’ll find the branch of Rosenfeld’s dry cleaning chain in which he generously allows Sydney pick of the uncollected garments, which is (the entirely respectable)Reliable Cleaners, 214 West Central Streetat Wellesley Avenue.\nThe modest suburban home Irving shares with his wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) is54 Doonan Street, in theFulton Heightsneighbourhood ofMedford, a few miles northwest ofBoston.\nReinventing herself as English aristo Lady Edith Greensly, Sydney joins Irving to form a formidable team under the guise of grand-sounding but bogus ‘London Associates’.\nGiddy with success, the pair celebrate in the extravagant gilt and mirrored lobby of theFairmont Copley Plaza Hotel,138 St James Avenuein the heart ofBostonitself. This is also the hotel in whichTom Cruiseattended the law firm interview inSydney Pollack’s 1993John GrishamadaptationThe Firm.\nSuccess is short lived, as one of the marks they set up for their fake loan business turns out to be FBI agent DiMaso, who recruits the pair - and their expertise - to stage an elaborate deception.\nBack inWorcester, in theWorcester Art Museum,55 Salisbury Street, Irving reveals to DiMaso that the famedRembrandtportrait ofSt Bartholomewis a fake, to make the point that “People believe what they want to believe”.\nThe museum is at pains to point out that the Rembrandt is the real deal, but the film seems to have opened up a can of worms with the painting’s provenance now being questioned in real life. Check it out and make up your own mind.\nThere’s a glimpse of the exterior ofNew York’s famedHotel Chelsea, 222 West 23rd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues,  as the team meets up with Carl Elway with a plan to revitalise Atlantic City, which sucks in Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) – \"the most quietly powerful person in the state of New Jersey\".\nAnother famousNew Yorkhotel, thePlaza Hotel,Fifth Avenue at 59th Street, is the site of the first meeting with Polito, outside which Irving has a job on his hands convincing the Mayor that the deal is above board, after a clumsy attempt to compromise him with a case of cash.\nPolito is seen  meeting and greeting constituents on the streets of ‘Camden, NJ’, which is once againMillbury StreetinWorcester.\nPolito calls for support from the unions inside theWorcester Memorial AuditoriumonLincoln Square. The mural, painted “during the depression”, is a real landmark, the work of artistLeon Krollin the 1930s and, at the time, the largest of its kind in the United States. Sadly, the disused building is currently closed to the public.\nIrving assures  Polito that no middlemen are involved, while their respective partners discuss nail varnish, over a meal at classy Italian restaurant ‘Baron’s’.

You can see the distinctive arched frontage ofValet Cleanersat38 Church Street, just north of Wellington Street East.\nWhen Bateman fails to get a table at the fabled ‘Dorsia’ (this restaurant was no more than the invention of authorBret Easton Ellis), he takes the whacked-out Courtney (Samantha Mathis) to ‘Barcadia’ instead.\nIt’s not only Courtney who’s being fobbed off. The slightly kitschy Pacific Rim restaurant was actually Monsoon,100 Simcoe Streetat Adelaide Street West inToronto. The premises now housesMichael's On Simcoesteak house. In fact, since many of the bars and restaurants were necessarily cutting-edge, it's not surprising that since 2000, several have closed or moved on.\nThere's another glimpse ofNew Yorkas Bateman leaves his place of work, walking past the statue ofGeorge Washingtonin front ofFederal Hall,Wall Streetat Nassau Street in theFinancial District. You'll recognise this as the spot where Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) donated  four million dollars to “a bunch o'nuns” in 1990'sGhost.\nBateman tries, and fails, to impress Paul Allen (Jared Leto) by getting a seat at the near-empty ‘Texarkana’. The wood-beamed, Western-themed restaurant was Montana, which stood at145 John Streetat Richmond Street West. It’s now part ofThe Ballroom, a bowling alley-leisure-bar complex.\nThere's a quick Second Unit shot of the exterior of Paul Allen's apartment block – which Bateman enviously notes has a park view – which is2 East 88th Streetat Fifth Avenue, alongside theGuggenheim MuseuminManhattan.\nThe comfortable-looking gentlemen’s club, where Bateman’s quote fromEd Geingoes unrecognised (“Isn’t he maitre d’ at Canal Bar?”), and Luis Carruthers (Matt Ross) comes close to extinction when he flashes his unmatchable new business card, is theConsort Barof the prestigious 1903Omni King Edward Hotel,37 King Street East. This elegant bar has barely changed, apart from being dominated by a huge portrait ofQueen Alexandra(wife ofKing Edward VII, and hence Consort).\nSerial killer aficionados will recognise that the quote attributed to the notoriousEd Gein(inspiration for bothPsychoandThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre) was actually from the slightly less-famous 'Co-ed Killer'Ed Kemper.\nUp towardCabbagetownis thePhoenix Concert Theatre,410 Sherbourne Street, now  a nightclub and live music venue, which was used as the ‘Studio 54’-style dance club, where the none-too-bright yuppies consider, between nosefuls of coke, whether dyslexia may be caused by a virus.\n‘Smith and Wollensky’ is a real enoughNew Yorkrestaurant – you can see it on-screen inThe Devil Wears Prada, but the restaurant where Bateman squirms through an edgy lunch with Det Kimball (Willem Dafoe) wasToronto's Savoy Restaurant. This is now virtually unrecognisable after being converted intoJazz Bistro,251 Victoria Street, off Dundas Street West, almost facing the Ed Mirvish Theatre.\nShark City seems the perfect name for one of the film’s locations. It’s closed now, but it was used as the restaurant in which Bateman’s girlfriend Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) doesn’t notice he’s doodling chainsaws and hookers on the napkin, or realise how lucky she is he’s breaking up with her. It stood at117 Eglinton Avenue East, a couple of miles north of downtown Toronto inMt Pleasant West. There's no trace of it today.\nProbably the longest sequence filmed inNew Yorkis that of Bateman trying to obey the ATM's mysterious command 'Feed me a stray cat'. The little covered arcade runs along the north side ofRector Street, between Trinity Place and Greenwich Street, just west of Wall Street and Federal Hall.\nWhen his shooting of a woman, who has the temerity to question his treatment of a kitten, attracts the attention of a passing police car, Bateman sprints off pastRector Street Stationnorth upGreenwich Streetto...Toronto.\nThe subsequent shoot-out with the police was filmed onPearl StreetbetweenSimcoeandDuncan Streets, just around the corner from Monsoon /Michael's On Simcoe. There's another hint that what we're seeing might not be literal truth when even Bateman seems surprised that his gunshots can blow up the cop car in a spectacular ball of fire.\nRattled, Bateman races back to the security of his office at theDominion Centre, where there's a dark little joke aboutRohe's two original high-rise towers appearing identical – resulting in the casual death of an unfortunate security guard in the wrong building.\nFinally locating the correct office, Bateman phones his lawyer and leaves a frantic phone message confessing everything and offering to meet the following day in 'Harry's Bar'.\nThis upscale bar, where the final scene takes an unnerving twist as Bateman is denied either justice or catharsis, was the upper crust Boston Club. It's changed little over the years, though is nowBiff's Bistro,4 Front Street East, a block south of theOmni King Edward Hotel.\n", "locations": [{"name": "Toronto", "address": "Toronto, Golden Horseshoe, Ontario, Canada", "latitude": 43.6534817, "longitude": -79.3839347, "descriptions": ["The movie was shot almost entirely inToronto,Ontario, with the realNew Yorkfeatured only  in a sprinkling of establishing shots, and the address of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), 11th Floor of the \"American Gardens Building on West 81st Street' is fictitious.", "We're immediately back inTorontofor the dry cleaners where Bateman explodes with fury at their inability to deal with – um – 'cranberry juice' stains on his expensive sheets.

{"url": "https://movie-locations.com/movies/a/American-Werewolf-In-London.php", "title": "An American Werewolf In London | 1981", "image": "https://movie-locations.com/movies/a/American-Werewolf-In-London.jpg", "text_content": "Discover whereAn American Werewolf in London(1981) was filmed aroundLondon– includingEarl's Court, Hampstead, SouthwarkandPiccadilly Circus; the villageCrickadarninWales; andThe Black Swan pubinSurrey.\nUnsurprisingly, the locations forJohn Landis’ horror-comedy can be found mainly aroundLondon, though with a brief detour intoWales, standing in for  ‘Yorkshire’.\nWhen American backpacker David Kessler (David Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) are dropped off from the back of a sheep-wagon on the ‘Yorkshire Moors’, they’re travelling north through theBlack MountainsofSouthWales, on the road fromCapel-y-ffintoHay-on-Wye, just west of the English border.\nThe ‘East Proctor’ road sign was added by the fork in the road immediately south ofHay Bluff car parkabout halfway between the two towns, overlooked by the green slope ofFfynnon Beacon.\nThey have quite a walk ahead of them to reach the village, which isCrickadarn, about eight miles to the west.\nCrickadarnis about six miles southeast of Builth Wells off the A479. The ‘Angel of Death’ statue was a prop added for the film, but the exterior of the pub and the red phone box are real enough – and Welsh road signs were covered by a fake tree.\nA pub full of furtively tight-lipped locals can only mean bad news, but if you want to join the locals here for a pint at 'The Slaughtered Lamb', it’s back toEngland. Although the exterior was an empty (now restored – so please do not disturb the residents) cottage dressed up for the movie, the interior was a real pub.\nThe interior of ‘The Slaughtered Lamb’ is inSurrey. It’sThe Black Swan,Old Laneat the junction with Ockham Lane,Martyr’s Green, about a mile northwest ofEffingham Junctionbetween Guildford and Leatherhead. The photogenic pub, also featured in TV’sInspector Morse, but has been given a radical makeover since the Eighties.\nIt’s now a smart restaurant-pub and you’ll need to use a little imagination to recognise it as the old-world inn whereLila Kayetended bar, a  youngRik Mayallplayed chess andBrian Gloverheld court. The wall which bore the pentagram was a false addition for the film (it’s actually the doorway to what is now the main dining room) and the bench seats are gone, but the layout remains the same. Oh, and there’s no longer a dartboard.\nThe hospital in which David Kessler (David Naughton) recovers from a nasty wolf bite was Putney General Hospital,Lower Common, Putney SW15, which had closed briefly in the early Eighties. It closed for good in 1999 and was demolished in 2014.\nAlthough Putney supplied the general hospital scenes,  David's room and the office in which Dr Hirsch (John Woodvine) is questioned by police were filmed at Chiswick Maternity Hospital,Netheravon Road South, London SW4, which, after being closed in 1975, was also used in several TV productions including the BBC hospital soapAngels. It went on to become a nursing home but it, too, has since been demolished.\n(thanks to Stephan Dicke for this correction)\nWith nowhere to stay on being discharged from hospital, David is obligingly taken in by his rather smitten nurse, Alex Price (Jenny Agutter). Her flat, where David ends up shape-shifting toSam Cooke’sBlue Moon, is64 Coleherne Road, Earls Court, SW10, oppositeSt Luke’s Church. Both exteriors and some of the interiors were filmed here.\nFollowing his transformation, David becomes an extremely well-travelled werewolf, first making his way fromSouthwestLondonto poshHampsteadin the northwest.\nThe Edwardian red-brick mansion block, where the posh couple unwisely decide to give their friends a surprise by sneaking around to the rear of the property, isThe Pryors, East Heath Road, Hampstead, NW3. The ‘park’, onto which very desirable property backs, are the woods on the southwest edge ofHampstead Heath.\nWhy not fit in a little sight-seeing while satisfying that craving for human flesh? From here, David ranges across the city to turn up on the north bank of theRiver Thamesjust east ofTower Bridge, where he comes across those three unfortunate old homeless guys. The whole area, north and south of the river, has been seriously redeveloped since 1981 so you’re unlikely to stumble across a pile of abandoned cars.\nYou can see more ofTower Bridgeof course inSpider-Man: Far From Home.\nDavid next turns up in a near-deserted underground station. Aldwych Station in the Strand is almost invariably rented out to film companies, since it’s permanently closed and at the end of a spur line, causing no disruption to services. Unusually, the tube station, where the city gent gets chomped, is the busyTottenham Court Road Station, though filmed in the wee small hours. Notice the first glimpse of the poster forJohn Landis’s trademarkSee You Next Wednesdaymovie?\nNext morning, David wakes up naked, remembering nothing, in the Wolf House ofLondon ZooinRegent’s Park,NW1. This place seems to have a strange fascination forLondon-based 80s cult movies – rememberRichard E GrantperformingHamletfor the unimpressed wolves at the end ofWithnail & I?\nNeedless to say, theZoohas had a major makeover in the intervening years, though you can still see its famousMappin Terraces, those reinforced concrete mountain structures, now rebranded asThe Outback, home to emus and wallabies.\nEn-route to see Dr Hirsch, David hears about the previous night’s carnage and leaps out of the cab inTrafalgar Square, the tourist heart ofLondon. The cab driver is a youngAlan Ford, now a regular heavy inLondongangster movies (he was Brick Top inGuy Ritchie’sSnatch).\nUnable to get arrested by an unflappable British copper, David hides out in the Eros Cinema which stood on the north side ofPiccadilly Circus, which happens to be showing – yes! –See You Next Wednesday.\nThe tiny cinema is long gone, and is now a branch ofGAPclothes store on the corner ofShaftesbury AvenueinPiccadilly Circus, more recently featured inHarry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1. You can see the cinema in its heyday in 1949 when the kids go to see the 'Siege of Burgundy' in classic Ealing comedyPassport To Pimlico.\nAnd once againJohn Landisdemonstrates his talent for staging major set-pieces in impossible locations by setting the climactic mayhem smack in the middle ofPiccadilly Circusitself – although, if you look carefully, you can see a wobbly street sign.\nIn fact, some of this sequence was filmed on a mock-up of the Circus atTwickenham Studios.\nBut you'd be hard pressed to find that old alleyway where the wolf is finally cornered anywhere near theWest End.\nThis was filmed inSouthwark, south of the river, between Southwark and London Bridges. This was an area of old warehouses criss-crossed by narrow cobbled lanes which has since been massively redeveloped. Contemporary sources claimed that the final confrontation was filmed on Winchester Walk, where a false wall was built across the road to give that dead end.\nThis was difficult to verify because of the extensive rebuilding but, after several others (including the always excellentReelStreets), mentioned the filming site was nearbyClink Street, it was time to revisit.\nSouthwarkis a fascinating historic area. Lying just across the River Thames and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the old City of London, it became the area for disreputable entertainment – brothels, bear-baiting and even theatre (the Globe where many ofWilliam Shakespeare's plays were first performed was close by, as is the modern reconstruction,Shakespeare's Globe).\nAlthough there are now many modern properties, the original road layout and the footprint of the buildings has been preserved. Going back toAmerican Werewolf, it's clear that the final scenes were indeed staged onClink Street, where the police arrive on the scene chasing through the brick tunnel which runs east, beneath the railway lines, fromBank End.\nThe building you can see at the end of the tunnel is now theClink Prison Museum, standing on the site of the old Clink Prison, dating from 1144, and which was notorious enough for the name 'clink' to become general slang for lock-ups.\nClink Streetturns and widens slightly to becomePickfords Wharf, and that's where the 'cul-de-sac' wall was built for the film's tragic ending. Much of the north side ofClink Street is still recognisable but the south side, which remained a mix of wasteland and crumbling brickwork at the time of filming, has been completely rebuilt.\nJust behind where the false dead-end was built, stands St Mary Overie Dock where you'll now find a reconstruction of theGolden Hinde, the ship in whichSir Francis Drakecircumnavigated the globe at the end of the 1570s.\nAlthough the old buildings are gone, you'll recognise the slight crook as the street narrows. Another bit of tourist info if you're visiting: on the right here you can now see what remains of the grand 12th Century Winchester Palace, uncovered during all the redevelopment in the Eighties.\nEagle-eyed location spotters might just about make out in the dark distance on the north side ofClink Street, the warehouse which went on to become the smart apartment of Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) inBridget Jones's Diary(the Globe Pub, above which Bridget lives, is just a little to the south on Bedale Street).\nAnd if all this exploring leaves you needing a sit down and a drink, the western entrance to the Clink Street tunnel faces the Anchor Tavern, the pub where Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) unwinds at the end ofBrian De Palma'sMission: Impossible.\n• Many thanks toLanny C JonesandStephan Dickefor help and corrections with this section.\n", "locations": [{"name": "London", "address": "Greater London, England, United Kingdom", "latitude": 51.5074456, "longitude": -0.1277653, "descriptions": ["Discover whereAn American Werewolf in London(1981) was filmed aroundLondon– includingEarl's Court, Hampstead, SouthwarkandPiccadilly Circus; the villageCrickadarninWales; andThe Black Swan pubinSurrey."]}, {"name": "Piccadilly Circus", "address": "Piccadilly Circus, St. James's, Mayfair, City of Westminster, Greater London, England, W1J 9HS, United Kingdom", "latitude": 51.5101383, "longitude": -0.133936, "descriptions": ["Discover whereAn American Werewolf in London(1981) was filmed aroundLondon– includingEarl's Court, Hampstead, SouthwarkandPiccadilly Circus; the villageCrickadarninWales; andThe Black Swan pubinSurrey.", "Unable to get arrested by an unflappable British copper, David hides out in the Eros Cinema which stood on the north side ofPiccadilly Circus, which happens to be showing – yes! –See You Next Wednesday.", "The tiny cinema is long gone, and is now a branch ofGAPclothes store on the corner ofShaftesbury AvenueinPiccadilly Circus, more recently featured inHarry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1.

The home ofJohn Jay, one of America's Founding Fathers and co-author of theTreaty of Pariswhich ended the Revolutionary War, is now a State Historic Site.Katonahis about 40 miles north of New York City.\nIt’s outside theMuscoot Inn, 105 Somerstown Road, to the west ofKatonah, that the cop notices the unusual amount of traffic, and sparks of the raid.\nThe warehouse, in which Vitti’s interrogation of an unfortunate victim is interrupted by an unwanted emotional attack, was the old Maxwell House plant inHoboken,New Jersey. Built in 1938 (at the time the largest coffee factory in the world), the landmark building stood at1125 Hudson Street, but has since been demolished and replaced with condos.\nVitti’s ‘heart failure’turns out to be an anxiety attack, diagnosed atElmhurst Hospital Center, 79-01 Broadway,Elmhurst, inQueens.\nIt’s toUpper Montclair,New Jersey, that Vitti travels to consult psychiatrist Dr Sobel at his home,538 Park Street, between Alexander Avenue and Overlook Road.\nSobel’s life is inevitably turned upside down. Until it’s disrupted, Sobel’s wedding  to Laura MacNamara (Lisa Kudrow) is going ahead inMiami Beach,Florida, at the expensiveSt Regis Bal Harbor Resort,9701 Collins Avenueat 96th Avenue,Bal Harbour. Vitti, naturally, stays in the hotel’sPresidential Suite.\nThe nautically-themed bar, with its tank of mermaids, to which Sobel is summoned by Vitti, is theWreck Barat what was the Sheraton Fort Lauderdale Beach Hotel, now theB Ocean Fort Lauderdale,1140 Seabreeze Boulevard,Fort Lauderdale. Unfortunately, the real bar isn’t quite as wonderfully kitsch – most of the OTT décor is courtesy of the film’s art department – though you can see the mermaids.\nA refusal to Vitti’s invitation sees Dr Sobel dunked into the shark tank at theMiami Seaquarium,4400 Rickenbacker Causeway(the sharks are CGI – it’s actually theManatee Tankthat was used).\nSobel’sGodfather-inspired dream of being gunned down while buying oranges, cleverly uses the sameNew Yorkstreet on which Don Corleone’s attempted assassination. Exiting202 Mott Street, Sobel is attacked after buying fruit at the fruit stand at203 Mott StreetinLittle Italy.\nHe tells Vitti of his dream while attending the funeral of a snitch at theChurch of St Luke and St Matthew, 520 Clinton Avenue, Brooklyn. The Episcopalian church had to be redressed as Catholic, after the Catholic church refused co-operation following the filming ofAbel Ferrara’sBad Lieutenant.\nThe Italian-American social club is onMulberry Streetat Spring Street inNew York’sLittle Italy. ‘Paretti’s’, the restaurant in which it turns out Vitti’s father was gunned down, is fictitious. It was built onKenmare Street. This interior was also used for the Mulberry Street social club and, more surprisingly, as Vitti’s house.\nVitti finally opens up to his emotions while attempting to whack Dr Sobel on theNewark Baywaterfront onStaten Island, in front of theBayonne Bridge(that’s the same bridge destroyed by aliens neat the beginning ofSteven Spielberg’sWar Of The Worlds).\nSobel and Laura finally get, hurriedly, married in theWaldorf Astoria New York,301 Park Avenue(incidentally, the same hotel had also served for Sobel’s father’s book launch at the opening of the film) inNew York. The often-used hotel can also be seen inWoody Allen’sHannah And Her Sistersand inWes Anderson’sThe Royal Tenenbaums.\nAs Sobel is whisked off to pose as Consigliare at the high-level mob meeting, the cops are foiled with seven identical limos emerging from the tunnel to the toll gates of theQueens Midtown Tunnel.\nThe venue for the meeting, the ‘Tops Limousine Service’, is the garage of a bus company inRed Hook, Brooklyn(though the interior was an empty factory inLong Island City,Queens).\nFinally cured – and brought to justice – Dr Sobel visits a reformed Vitti at the realSing Sing Prison, inOssining,New York State.\n", "locations": [{"name": "400 Jay Street", "address": "The UPS Store, 400, Jay Street, Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Kings County, City of New York, New York, 11201, United States", "latitude": 40.6920978, "longitude": -73.9874725, "descriptions": ["The opening flashback of the ‘Appalachian’ mafia meeting (a scene based on a real event) is held at theJohn Jay Homestead,400 Jay Street, to the east ofKatonah.

But since the plot sees a sinister organisation threatening to blow up the Vatican with a glass jar full of anti-matter kept in check by the battery from a Casio watch, that was hardly an option.\nOwing less to  Galileo and Bernini, more to Dr Phibes and The Riddler,Angels And Demonssucceeds as a fast-paced fun ride, and any supposed insult to the church fades into insignificance alongside insults to scientists, art historians, geographers and  screenwriting students who’ve learned not to lumber characters with chunks of unspeakable exposition.\nNeedless to say, that is not the real ‘Vatican’. Nor is it the real ‘Harvard’, where the Professor of Symbology (a post which seems to be filled by anyone able to complete the local paper’s backpage crossword) is approached by a Papal representative. Despite the CGI background, it’sRoyce HallUniversity of California,Los Angeles(UCLA) on the city’s Westside. Built in 1929, in the Romanesque Revival style (it’s modelled after the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan), the campus has been seen in numerous films.\nThe ‘Sistine Chapel’ was, obviously, recreated in the studio (as were most of the Roman interiors), but if you sawStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menaceyou might recognise the ‘Vatican’s’ marble staircases and corridors – they were seen as Queen Amidala’s ‘Theed Palace’ on ‘Naboo’. The grandiose interior is  theReggia di Caserta (Royal Palace of Caserta), Piazza Carlo III, inCaserta, about 15 miles north ofNaples. The huge Baroque palace, built in 1752, for King Charles III of Naples to rival France’s Versailles, is open to visitors. It stood in for the ‘Vatican’ again inJJ Abrams'Mission: Impossible 3, and in 1970 was seen as the ‘Parisian’ palace of Louis XVIII (Orson Welles) inSergei Bondarchuk’s epicWaterloo, withRod Steigeras Napoleon.\nThe rest of the plot focuses onRome, with Prof Langdon (Tom Hanks) tracking down obscure references to the four elements – earth, air, fire and water – supposedly left by the sculptor Bernini.\nThe Illuminatus pathway starts at the tomb of painter Raphael, in thePantheon, on  thePiazza della Rotonda, bang in the historic centre of the city.  Amazingly, thePantheondates from around 125AD, and is one of the most influential buildings ever,  topped by  a marvel of structural engineering – the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world. Originally built as a temple to the Roman gods, since the 7th century it’s been a Roman Catholic church. ThePantheonis also featured inPeter Greenaway’s quirkyThe Belly Of An Architect.\nLangdon deduces that the first step – earth – leads north, to another location seen inGreenaway’s film, thePiazza del Popolo.   Although the main entrance to the piazza is from thevia del Corsobetween the twin churches of Santa Maria in Montesanto and Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Langdon’s destination isSanta Maria del Popoloon the north side, which contains Bernini’sHabakkuk and the Angelin theChigi Chapel.  It’s in the crypt of the church (which, I’m sure I don’t need to tell you was recreated in the studio) that he discovers  the first cardinal, his mouth crammed with soil. Until 1826, thePiazza del Popolowas in fact used for public executions.\nFrom here, there’s cinema fakery as the ‘air’ trail leads toVatican City– way west, across the Tiber, toSt Peter’s Square, in front of theBasilica of St Peter, where Langdon discovers another of those easily-opened manhole covers that only a trained Symbologist can recognise. Refused permission to film within Vatican City, the scene mixes a huge set with more digital imagery. The marker is is theWest Ponentewind rose tile, located on the west side of the base of the Vatican obelisk in the center of the square.\nThe angel’s breath whizzes us back east across the city, to the 17th centurySanta Maria della Vittoria,via XX Settembreat  Largo Santa Susanna, which houses one of the finest statues in Rome, if not the world – Bernini’s astonishingEcstasy of Saint Teresa,  in theCornaro Chapel. The statue depicts an experience described by Saint Teresa of Avila, in innocently pre-Freudian times,  “In his hands I saw a great golden spear, and at the iron tip there appeared to be a point of fire. This he plunged into my heart several times so that it penetrated my entrails. When he pulled it out I felt that he took them with it, and left me utterly consumed by the great love of God. The pain was so severe that it made me utter several moans. The sweetness caused by this intense pain is so extreme that one can not possibly wish it to cease...”\nThe plot interprets this as the third element – fire – and, sure enough, this is where Langdon discovers smoky bar-b-cued cardinal.\nThe fourth element  is represented by   Bernini’s dramaticFountain of the Four Rivers, inPiazza Navona, not too far from the starting place, thePantheon, where, after the cops have been furtively shot, the fourth cardinal is unceremoniously dumped into the water. The fountain, erected in 1651, depicts allegories of the four great rivers in the four continents recognised by Renaissance geographers: the Nile in Africa, Ganges in Asia, Danube in Europe, and Río de la Plata in America.\nThe final clue reveals that the ‘Chapel of the Illuminati’ is located inCastel Sant Angelo, on the Tiber’s west bank, not far from the Vatican  (to which it’s supposedly linked by a secret underground tunnel). Commissioned by the Emperor Hadrian as a mausoleum for himself and his family, the building has seen service as a fortress and castle, and is now a museum. On the top floor, there’s a terrace with spectacular views over the city (and opera buffs will know that it is from here that Puccini’sToscaleapt to her death).\n", "locations": [{"name": "Royce Hall", "address": "Royce Hall, Thorpe Acre, Loughborough, Charnwood, Leicestershire, England, United Kingdom", "latitude": 52.7654311, "longitude": -1.2364661, "descriptions": ["Needless to say, that is not the real ‘Vatican’.

Or Frederiksbad? Or neither? Sorry to be so prosaic, but it wasMunich. Three overwrought baroque castles were knitted together to make a single, vast, labyrinthine hotel.\nYou could go crazy trying to untangleAlain Resnais’ sinuous jigsaw, one location flowing seamlessly into another, the layout of the garden endlessly changing and doors not always opening onto the same room.\nNot surprisingly, the major location, a gigantic rococo palace where elegantly attired guests play arcane games, was once home to the famously extravagantKing Ludwig I. It’sSchloss Nymphenburg, 200 years in the building and half a mile from wingtip to wingtip, in a northwest suburb of the city.Ludwig, while struggling with his sexuality, managed to scandalise society by commissioning a series of portraits of women – including notorious courtesanLola Montes– which now hang in the palace’sSchönheitengalerie(The Gallery of Beauties).\nThe largest of its kind inGermany, the palace is set in 500 acres of parkland, varying from the wild to the geometrically formal French-style gardens seen in the film.Nymphenburgcan be reached by the number 12 streetcar or the 41 bus from downtownMunich. It’s open Tuesdays to Sundays.\nIf you've seenBill Condon's 2017 live-action film ofBeauty And The Beast, you might notice that Belle's bedroom in the castle is based onNymphenburg's Hall of Mirrors.\nIn the grounds is the hunting lodge,Amalienburg, second of the movie’s locations. If ‘hunting lodge’ conjures up images of rustic simplicity, you’re in for a surprise. The interior is even more florid thanNymphenburg; a white, green and gold rococo fantasy centered around the sumptuousSpiegelsaal, the Hall of Mirrors.Resnaishas loads of fun here with the endless reflections, seen over the opening monologue and used as the setting for the concert of the final evening together of A (Delphine Seyrig) and X (Giorgio Albertazzi).\nThe plainer exterior, seen as ‘Frederiksbad’ inAlbertazzi’s memories and in the framed pictures throughout the film, is theNeues SchlossofSchloss Schleissheim, housing the Bayerische Staatsgalerie collection of baroque art. Find it to the northwest of Munich, on the S-1 urban line and the 292 bus toOberschleissheim.\nYou won’t be able to see the classical statue of Charles III and his wife, which appears to move constantly about the gardens, though. Based on characters in a painting byNicolas Poussin, it was built specially for the movie. You can pose in the formal gardens, but if you want to appear as stylish as the cast, the trick is to organise your own accessories.

No, you’ll find no block here. It’s theHarrison Street Parking Lot, 1515 Harrison Streetat 15th Street, inOakland, across the bay fromSan Francisco.\nThere’s a good reason an empty lot was used. When Hope and Hank Pym move on, the entire block is quickly shrunk to wheelie-luggage size and loaded into the car. It’s easy to pop the CGI building into any convenient location. And that’s going to happen a lot.⏏\n▶ With a quick glimpse of theOakland Bay Bridge, we head intoSan Franciscoand a meeting with black-marketeer Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins) at his ‘Oui’ restaurant. Suddenly, we’re inDowntownAtlanta, where this is200 Peachtree Street NW. It's theWhitehallat 1927Southern Exchange Ballrooms, now an events space – and a wedding venue if you’re a die-hard Wasp fan (or a Sonny Burch fan for that matter).\nBurch supplies Pym with tech parts but now he’s eager to move into Quantum technology with the help of Pym’s lab.\nThey’re both wrongfooted when the minilab is snatched by a mysterious entity with the ability to pass through walls.⏏\n▶ Now without a base, Scott and Hope hide out with Scott’s business partner Luis (Michael Pena) and his crew at the premises of ‘X-Con Security Consultants’ business, above 'J&J Jewellers'.\nIf anything looked like set-dressing to hide a real location, it’s that ostentatious ‘J&J’ sign. But, no – that’s a real business at76 Peachtree Street SWnear MLK Jr Drive, a few blocks south of the ‘Oui’ location. It doesn’t look like the store is going to benefit from the publicity – it seems to have closed down.⏏\n▶ Hank Pym needs help from his old partner Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne) who’s working at theUniversity of California, Berkeley.\nWith Hope and Scott, he enters the campus via the famousSather Gate, onSather Roadrunning north from Bancroft Way. This was once the main entrance to the University, but since expansion of the grounds, it now just separates the centre of the campus from Sproul Plaza.⏏\n▶ That’s all we see ofBerkeley. Foster’s lecture theatre is theWhite HallofEmory University, 201 Dowman DriveinAtlanta.\nEmoryis no stranger to the screen, having appeared in 2000’sRoad Trip,Into The Wild(the realChris McCandlessgraduated fromEmory),Hidden Figures,Marc Webb’s 2017Gifted, withChris Evans, and TV’sStranger Things⏏.\nTo track down the whereabouts of the stolen lab, the technology of the original Ant suit is needed. Wouldn’t you know it, Scott’s daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) has unwittingly taken it to ‘Show and Tell’ at school.\n▶ The ground here is flat, so it looks like we're remaining inAtlanta. ‘Brookemont Elementary School’ is theMorningside Elementary School, 774 Virginia Avenue NEin theVirginia Highlanddistrict northeast ofDowntown.⏏\n▶ The lab can now be tracked to an extraordinary Modernist concrete home, where it’s being held by Ava (Hannah John-Kamen) who, having been subjected to “molecular disequilibrium”, has acquired the ability of being able to pass through solid objects. She’s being helped fight this painful, and apparently terminal, condition by Bill Foster.\nI would happily have assumed this to be a studio set but, amazingly, this is a real (and private) residence:22 Woodlane Drivein the city ofNewnan, about 40 miles southwest ofAtlanta. New owners have proudly named it theQuantumhouse, and you can follow itsTwitter account.⏏\nRecovering the lab, Hank, Hope and Scott restore it to its full scale in ‘Muir Woods’. You’ll remember that’s the giant redwood forest north ofSan Franciscowhich is visited by Scottie and Madeleine inAlfred Hitchcock’s classicVertigo.\nHitchcockdidn’t film in the real woods and neither doesPeyton Reed. This is a forest near thePinewoodstudios inFayetteville.\nIt doesn’t take long for the feds, led by Jimmy Woo (Randall Park), to find the trio and take them into custody, allowing the lab, once again, to fall into the clutches of Ava, aka Ghost.\nIt’s a tough job, keeping size-changing tech wizards imprisoned, especially when they’re aided by an army of relentlessly obedient ants.\n▶ The three brazenly exit the police station via an anonymous doorway beneathWhite Oak Kitchen and Cocktailson the south side ofBaker Street NW at Peachtree Street NW, just a couple of blocks north of the ‘Oui’ location. Yes, there’s a bit of a slope here – the production did manage to find one of the few hills inAtlanta.⏏\n▶ We’re back on the trail of the stolen lab, briefly in the realSan Francisco, driving east onFilbert Streettowards the twin spires ofSaints Peter and Paul Cathedral(familiar fromDirty Harry) andCoit Tower(VertigoandDoctor Dolittle), a stretch of road you might recognise fromBullitt.⏏\n▶ The lab has been blown up to full scale again in one of those suitably deserted industrial areas that, according to the movies, every city has.\nMarvelfans may be familiar with this spot from the beginning ofCaptain America: Civil War, when it was used as the ‘Lagos’ market where fighting off an attack goes horribly wrong.\nThis was an area known asThe Gulch, onTed Turner Drive SWandMitchell Street SW, just southwest ofDowntownAtlanta. That huge block is, predictably, being developed, becoming theCentennial Yardsapartment complex, with the Gulch becoming its parking area.⏏\nA bit of misdirection from Scott sees the lab conveniently shrunken and grabbed, leading to a crazy car chase throughSan Francisco, referencing films fromBullitttoWhat’s Up Doc?\nThere’s really no way of reproducing the city’s famous hills so much of the sequence is the real thing.\n▶ How can any self-respecting chase through the city avoid the famous set of switchback curves on the1000 BlockofLombard StreetbetweenLeavenworthandHyde StreetsinRussian Hill, self-styled ‘Crookedest Street in the World’?Ant-Man and the Waspups the ante with some spectacular car flips (which were achieved with extremely convincing digital effects).The street is seen in plenty of madcap chases includingDisney'sThe Love BugandPeter Bogdanovich's 1972 screwball comedyWhat's Up Doc?By the way, if you're a visiting location spotter, don't forget that on the next block east, 900 Lombard Street was the home ofJames StewartinAlfred Hitchcock's 1958Vertigo.⏏(anchor)Ant-Man and the Wasp film location: Stan Lee's cameo as the old San Francisco stoner: Mitchell Street, Atlanta |Photograph:Google Maps\nThe street is seen in plenty of madcap chases includingDisney'sThe Love BugandPeter Bogdanovich's 1972 screwball comedyWhat's Up Doc?By the way, if you're a visiting location spotter, don't forget that on the next block east, 900 Lombard Street was the home ofJames StewartinAlfred Hitchcock's 1958Vertigo.⏏(anchor)Ant-Man and the Wasp film location: Stan Lee's cameo as the old San Francisco stoner: Mitchell Street, Atlanta |Photograph:Google Maps\nBy the way, if you're a visiting location spotter, don't forget that on the next block east, 900 Lombard Street was the home ofJames StewartinAlfred Hitchcock's 1958Vertigo.⏏", "locations": [{"name": "601 Buena Vista Avenue West", "address": "601, Buena Vista Avenue West, Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco, California, 94117, United States", "latitude": 37.7669173, "longitude": -122.4440134, "descriptions": ["▶ The prologue’s flashback to Hank Pym’s (Michael Douglas) life with his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), before she disappeared into the Quantum Realm, briefly features the Pym house, at601 Buena Vista Avenue WestinSan Francisco’s famedHaight-Ashburydistrict.⏏"]}, {"name": "Haight-Ashbury", "address": "Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco, California, 94177, United States", "latitude": 37.770028, "longitude": -122.446982, "descriptions": ["▶ The prologue’s flashback to Hank Pym’s (Michael Douglas) life with his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), before she disappeared into the Quantum Realm, briefly features the Pym house, at601 Buena Vista Avenue WestinSan Francisco’s famedHaight-Ashburydistrict.⏏"]}, {"name": "Potrero Hill", "address": "Potrero Hill, San Francisco, California, 90103, United States", "latitude": 37.7565834, "longitude": -122.3991374, "descriptions": ["▶ The story proper follows on fromCaptain America: Civil War, with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) under house arrest for breaking those pesky old Sokovia Accords, at his home, above/alongside neighbourhood bookstoreChristopher’s Books,1400 18th Streetat Missouri Street, inSan Francisco’sPotrero Hilldistrict.⏏"]}, {"name": "Harrison Street Parking Lot, 1515 Harrison Street", "address": "Harrison Street Parking Lot, 405, Harrison Street, East Village Neighborhood, Flint, Genesee County, Michigan, 48502, United States", "latitude": 43.0175295, "longitude": -83.6893747, "descriptions": ["▶ She drives him to the deserted-looking office block where Pym currently houses the lab containing his tunnel to the Quantum Realm.
